# Manipulation of share price by first depositor of IVault

## Summary
First depositor of `IVault` can manipulate share price.
## Vulnerability Detail
Someone created new PublicVault.
Alice buys first share for 1 wei using `AstariaRouter.lendToVault` function. Price of 1 share becomes 1 wei.
Then Alice donates a big amount `aliceAmount` to PublicVault directly(simple ERC20 transfer). Now we have  `1 wei` amount of shares and `aliceAmount + 1` of deposit asset controlled by PublicVault.

Then Bob deposits arbitrary amount of assets, that is `bobAmount > aliceAmount`.
As result Bob receives `bobAmount / (aliceAmount + 1)` shares because of rounding here. Bob loses part of `bobAmount % aliceAmount` sent to the vault, alice controls more assets in vault now.

So this is classic problem of first depositor.
## Impact
Next depositors can lost their money, while first user will take all of them or some part.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Usually limit is added to the amount of first depositor(first deposit should be big). But in this case you can't use the same for vaults. You need to think about the way increase total shares. Maybe you can mint some big amount of shares when the first deposit was provided.
