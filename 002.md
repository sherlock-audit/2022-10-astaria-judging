# deposit() and  mint() functions do not work

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The `ERC4626-Cloned` contract inherits from the `ERC20Cloned` and `ERC4626Base` contracts. When the user calls the deposit and mint functions of the  `ERC4626-Cloned` contract, the deposit and mint functions of the `ERC20Cloned` or  `ERC4626Base` contracts are called.

The deposit and mint functions of the `ERC20Cloned` or  `ERC4626Base` contracts will call the deposit and mint functions of the `ERC4626-Cloned` contract. The `ERC4626-Cloned` contract inherits from the ERC4626 contract, that is, the deposit and mint functions of the ERC4626 contract will be called.

The deposit and mint functions of the ERC4626 contract will call the safeTransferFrom function. Since the caller is the  `ERC4626-Cloned` contract, msg.sender will be the  `ERC4626-Cloned` contract. And because the user calls the deposit and mint functions of the  `ERC4626-Cloned` contract without transferring tokens to the  `ERC4626-Cloned` contract and approving the call will fail.

                {

                  require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

                  // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
                  ERC20(underlying()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

                  _mint(receiver, shares);

                  emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);

                  afterDeposit(assets, shares);

                 // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the deposit and mint functions of the `ERC4626-Cloned` contract, add code for the user to transfer tokens and approve the use of tokens in the Astaria contract.
