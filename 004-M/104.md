# Cancelling auction does not return the funds to the highest bidder

## Summary
The function `cancelAuction` deletes an auction and transfers the NFT back to the auction creator. However, this function only checks whether `currentBid < resevePrice`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently this issue is not demonstrable, because  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria-misoxxx/issues/1 prohibits users from bidding less then `reservePrice`. However, this is undocumented and probably a bug. 

If users will be able to bid less than `reservePrice`, than the function `cancelAuction` doesn't check for anything - it just gets the funds and deletes the auction. The expected behavior should also include sending `currentBid` back to the `bidder`.

## Impact
The highest bidder will lose funds and not get anything for them.

## Recommendation
The function should check whether  `currentBid`  is higher than 0, and if  yes it should return  `currentBid`  to the `bidder` by same logic as it does in `createBid`.
