# Using TransferFrom on ERC721 tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In the function flashAction of contract CollateralToken, when transferring external ERC721 tokens to the winners, the transferFrom keyword is used instead of safeTransferFrom.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L176

          'nft.transferFrom(address(this), address(receiver), tokenId);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing transferFrom to safeTransferFrom at line 176. However, it could introduce a DoS attack vector if any winner maliciously rejects the received ERC721 tokens to make the others unable to get their awards. Possible mitigations are to use a try/catch statement to handle error cases separately or provide a function for the pool owner to remove malicious winners manually if this happens.
