# ASTARIA_ROUTER.getProtocolFee will always revert

## Summary
`ASTARIA_ROUTER.getProtocolFee` will always revert, as `protocolFeeNumerator` and `protocolFeeDenominator` variables are not initialized with any values.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ASTARIA_ROUTER.protocolFeeNumerator` and `ASTARIA_ROUTER.protocolFeeDenominator` variables are not initialized anywhere in the contract and there is no ability to set them through the code. That leads to the fact that `ASTARIA_ROUTER.getProtocolFee` function will always revert because of divide by 0.

`ASTARIA_ROUTER.getProtocolFee` function is used by `VaultImplementation._handleProtocolFee`.

```solidity
  function _handleProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
    address feeTo = IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).feeTo();
    bool feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
    if (feeOn) {
      uint256 fee = IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).getProtocolFee(amount);


      unchecked {
        amount -= fee;
      }
      ERC20(underlying()).safeTransfer(feeTo, fee);
    }
    return amount;
  }
}
```

If `IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).feeTo()` is not address 0 then, all calls to `VaultImplementation._handleProtocolFee` will revert.
Note that it's possible to [set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L183-L185) `AstariaRouter.feeTo`.

As a result it's not possible to borrow.
## Impact
Borrow is not possible.
## Code Snippet
Just add this to `AstariaTest`.
```solidity
function testFeeDdos() public {
    vm.expectRevert();
    ASTARIA_ROUTER.getProtocolFee(10000);
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add ability to set `ASTARIA_ROUTER.protocolFeeNumerator` and `ASTARIA_ROUTER.protocolFeeDenominator` variables and validate input.
