# `protocolFee` and `buyoutFee` are not set in constructor() and there is no way to set its value

## Summary
4 variables namely `protocolFeeNumerator`, `protocolFeeDenominator`, `buyoutFeeNumerator`, `buyoutFeeDenominator` are not set in constructor() and there is no way to set them. This breaks many of the protocol important functionalities as `getProtocolFee()` and `getBuyoutFee()` will revert due to division by 0 because of this.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, `commitToLien()` calls `_requestLienAndIssuePayout()` which calls the method `_handleProtocolFee()` which calls `getProtocolFee()`. This always reverts which means that a loan can actually never be taken which breaks the protocol. Note that `_commitToLien()` in the test script is a different implementation.

Likewise, `getBuyoutFee()` function that always reverts prevents `buyoutLien()` from being callable.

## Impact
This oversight causes the most important functionality of the protocol to break hence I believe high severity to be correct.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set these important variables in `constructor()` or create a function that allows these values to be set.
