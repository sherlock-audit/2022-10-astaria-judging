# protocolFee/buyoutFee cannot be set

## Summary
protocolFee/buyoutFee cannot be set, so getProtocolFee/getBuyoutFee will always revert
## Vulnerability Detail
The four variables protocolFeeNumerator/protocolFeeDenominator/buyoutFeeNumerator/buyoutFeeDenominator are defined in the AstariaRouter contract, but there is no function to set these variables, so these variables are always 0, resulting in getProtocolFee/getBuyoutFee always revert.
This will make
1. When the user executes the commitToLien function, if feeTo != 0, the commitToLien will also be reverted due to getProtocolFee revert.
2. When the user executes the buyoutLien function, due to getBuyoutFee revert, buyoutLien will also be reverted.

## Impact
The main function of the contract is not available
