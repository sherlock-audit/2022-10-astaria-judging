# createAuction sets firstBidTime as time of creation rather than first bid

## Summary

Auctions run through AuctionHouse.sol are intended to start the auction duration from the first bid. However, the `firstBidTime` is set to `block.timestamp` in the `createAuction()` function, so the auction will end prematurely.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `createAuction()` function, `firstBidTime` is set to `block.timestamp`:

```solidity
newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
```

Later, in `createBid()`, the logic is included to set `firstBidTime` as the `block.timestamp` if it isn't set yet, so that the `firstBidTime` will represent the first bid on the contract:

```solidity
if (firstBidTime == 0) {
    auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
}
```

However, this code path is never taken, because the `firstBidTime` is has already been set.

## Impact

Auctions should run 2 days from the first bid, but instead will run 2 days from creation.
