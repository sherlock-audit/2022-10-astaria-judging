# firstBidTime can never be 0

## Summary
The auction creation already sets the firstBidTime so it could never be 0 meaning several statements which can only run when firstBidTime will never run

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe that while creating Auction firstBidTime is already set meaning it could never be 0

```python
function createAuction(
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 duration,
    address initiator,
    uint256 initiatorFee
  ) external requiresAuth returns (uint256 reserve) {
    (reserve, ) = LIEN_TOKEN.stopLiens(tokenId);

    Auction storage newAuction = auctions[tokenId];
...
    newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();

...
    emit AuctionCreated(tokenId, duration, reserve);
  }
```

## Impact
firstBidTime is never updated properly impacting the end time for Auction which is derived using firstBidTime

## Recommendation
Do not set firstBidTime while creating Auction instead do it once someone has bidded on it
