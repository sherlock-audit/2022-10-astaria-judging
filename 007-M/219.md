# AuctionHouse firstBidTime is set to block.timestamp which breaks the calculation of the Auction's total duration

## Summary

AuctionHouse.sol firstBidTime is initialized to block.timestamp instead of 0, which makes the duration of the Auction incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

    newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();

Since firstBidTime is set to block.timestamp and there is no bidder yet when the Auction starts, this [if conditional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L111-L116) will never run. 

    if (firstBidTime == 0) {
      auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
    } else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
      uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
      _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
    }
  
The firstBidTime thus acts as the start time of the Auction instead of the time of the first bid, which defies the [protocol logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L107)

    // If this is the first valid bid, we should set the starting time now.  

## Impact

Auction timing might cause confusion for bidders.

## Recommendation

Change Line 80

    newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();

to 

    newAuction.firstBidTime = 0;

Also make sure that the code in endAuction() is changed because if firstBidTime is 0, the auction can end immediately after it starts.

    require(
      ++ auctions[auctionId].firstBidTime !== 0 && 
      block.timestamp >= auctions[auctionId].firstBidTime + auctions[auctionId].duration,
      "Auction hasn't completed"
    );
