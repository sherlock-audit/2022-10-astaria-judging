# Auction's `firstBidTime` already initiated before any user bid the Auction lead to miss-information and shorten auction duration

## Summary
Auction's `firstBidTime` already initiated before first Bid from auction participant happen by calling `createBid()`, resulting miss-information of the auction itself and shorten auction duration.

## Vulnerability Detail
An auction is being initiate through `createAuction()` inside `AuctionHouse.sol` contract, which will create a new Auction with some values came from parameters. But the `firstBidTime` is being set with `block.timestamp` value, which this is not supposedly happen. 

The `firstBidTime` name by description of the variable name is the `time of first bid of the auction`, but in this situation, it is set as the time (timestamp) when the auction is being created.

If somehow the project use the `firstBidTime` as to describe the start of Auction (which I think it should use a better variable name to describe it), there are some issues which contradict to it, following lines:
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
098:     require(
099:       firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
100:       "Auction expired"
101:     );

111:     if (firstBidTime == 0) {
112:       auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
113:     } else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
114:       uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
115:       _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
116:     }
```
there are two occasion where it check if `firstBidTime == 0` which in this case, it wont happen at any scenarios, since the creation of an Auction will always set it to `block.timestamp` (Line:80). So, with this assumption, the `firstBidTime` at `createAuction()` supposed to set as 0.

If we look at when this `firstBidTime` is being used or accessed, there are some occurrences.  
1. ### `getAuctionData()`
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
226:   function getAuctionData(uint256 _auctionId)
227:     public
228:     view
229:     returns (
230:       uint256 amount,
231:       uint256 duration,
232:       uint256 firstBidTime,
233:       uint256 reservePrice,
234:       address bidder
235:     )
236:   {
237:     IAuctionHouse.Auction memory auction = auctions[_auctionId];
238:     return (
239:       auction.currentBid,
240:       auction.duration,
241:       auction.firstBidTime,
242:       auction.reservePrice,
243:       auction.bidder
244:     );
245:   }
```
Severity will depends on the usage of this output from this function, but in summary, this will return the wrong value, for example if the Auction is being created, and no one has bid, but the `firstBidTime` variable will return some time (which is the time of the Auction is being created)

2. ### `createBid()`
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
093:   function createBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external override {
...
097:     uint64 firstBidTime = auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime;
098:     require(
099:       firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
100:       "Auction expired"
101:     );
...
111:     if (firstBidTime == 0) {
112:       auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
113:     } else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
114:       uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
115:       _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
116:     }
...
127:     if (firstBidTime + duration - block.timestamp < timeBuffer) {
...
135:       uint64 newDuration = uint256(
136:         duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)
137:       ).safeCastTo64();
138:       if (newDuration <= auctions[tokenId].maxDuration) {
139:         auctions[tokenId].duration = newDuration;
140:       } else {
141:         auctions[tokenId].duration =
142:           auctions[tokenId].maxDuration -
143:           firstBidTime;
144:       }
145:       extended = true;
146:     }
...
159:   }
```

In a scenario where there is no Bid after Auction is created, on Line 98-101, there is a `require` for condition ` block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration`. So, if `firstBidTime` is already set even there is no bid, it will shorten the duration of auction if by mean of the require condition is to ensure duration is calculated when there is a bid happen.

3. ### `endAuction()`
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
172:     require(
173:       block.timestamp >=
174:         auctions[auctionId].firstBidTime + auctions[auctionId].duration,
175:       "Auction hasn't completed"
176:     );
```
This is might be a valid require condition if assumption `firstBidTime` is the `startAuctionTime`, but since our assumption is `firstBidTime` is first time someone bid the Auction, then it will affect the result.

## Impact
Miss-information of the Auction and Shorten the auction duration.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's better to add a new variable to Auction struct called `startAuctionTime` and replace the set of `firstBidTime`
