# AuctionHouse: Underflow in createBid

## Summary
Under some circumstances, there is an underflow within `createBid`, which makes some bids impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `createBid`, the following calculation is performed:
```solidity
        auctions[tokenId].duration =
          auctions[tokenId].maxDuration -
          firstBidTime; 
```
However, `maxDuration` is a duration (like 2 days) whereas `firstBidTime` is a timestamp. Therefore, this calculation will underflow.

## Impact
These bids will revert, meaning that bids that should be accepted will not, leading to a temporarily DoS and a loss of funds because those bids were not accepted.
