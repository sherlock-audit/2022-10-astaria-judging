# `AuctionHouse.createBid()` will revert when it should increase the duration.

## Summary
`AuctionHouse.createBid()` will revert when it should increase the duration.

## Vulnerability Detail
`AuctionHouse.createBid()` is designed to increase the duration when the difference between the current time and auction end time is less than `timeBuffer` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L134-L144).

```solidity
      uint64 newDuration = uint256(
        duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime) //@audit shouldn't add duration
      ).safeCastTo64();
      if (newDuration <= auctions[tokenId].maxDuration) {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = newDuration;
      } else {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = //@audit should minus firstBidTime
          auctions[tokenId].maxDuration -
          firstBidTime;
      }
```

`Auction.duration` is the length of time to run the auction, not the end time of the auction.

Currently, it calculates the `newDuration` like the end time of the auction and it will be greater than `auctions[tokenId].maxDuration` (like 7 days).

So it will update the duration [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L141-L143) and it will revert because `auctions[tokenId].maxDuration` is a duration like 7 days and `firstBidTime` is a real-time.

`AuctionHouse.createBid()` will revert because of uint underflow when it should extend the duration.

## Impact
Users can place a bid when the difference between the auction end time and the current time is less than `timeBuffer`.

Also, the end time extension logic won't work at all.

## Recommendation
We should modify [this part](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L134-L144) like below.

```solidity
      uint64 newDuration = uint256((block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)).safeCastTo64();

      if (newDuration <= auctions[tokenId].maxDuration) {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = newDuration;
      } else {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = auctions[tokenId].maxDuration;
      }
```
