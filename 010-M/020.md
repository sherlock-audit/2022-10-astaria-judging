# Anyone can create a Public Vault, even though they are intended to be permissioned

## Summary

The docs make clear that creating Public Vaults is a permissioned activity, but in the code, any user is able to create a Public Vault at any time.

## Vulnerability Detail

The docs state the following regarding Public Vaults:

> "Whitelisted strategists can deploy PublicVaults that accept funds from other liquidity providers."

However, in the code, the `newPublicVault` function is `external` and doesn't have any requirements that stop any user from deploying a Public Vault.

## Impact

Any user can deploy a Public Vault, despite the intentions of the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `AUTHORITY` contract to add permissions for whitelisted users to call the `newPublicVault` function, and add a `requiresAuth` modifier to the contract.
