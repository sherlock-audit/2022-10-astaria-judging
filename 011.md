## Summary
It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721.
## Vulnerability Detail
The recipient could have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom().
## Impact
There is the potential loss of NFTs should the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.
