# Existing Auction can be overwritten, any high bidder will lost their spot and asset

## Summary
Auction `createAuction` can be overwritten which will make existing (top) bidder lost their spot and asset (WETH)

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
67:   function createAuction(
68:     uint256 tokenId,
69:     uint256 duration,
70:     address initiator,
71:     uint256 initiatorFee
72:   ) external requiresAuth returns (uint256 reserve) {
73:     (reserve, ) = LIEN_TOKEN.stopLiens(tokenId);
74: 
75:     Auction storage newAuction = auctions[tokenId];
76:     newAuction.duration = duration.safeCastTo64();
77:     newAuction.reservePrice = reserve;
78:     newAuction.initiator = initiator;
79:     newAuction.initiatorFee = initiatorFee;
80:     newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
81:     newAuction.maxDuration = (duration + 1 days).safeCastTo64();
82:     newAuction.currentBid = 0;
83: 
84:     emit AuctionCreated(tokenId, duration, reserve);
85:   }
```
the `createAuction()` did not check if there is already an Auction created for the tokenId.  Even though the overwrite will keep the `bidder` value unchanged if old auction is being overwritten, but the `bidder` will be easily replaced as the `currentBid` will reset to be 0. 

Moreover, the old bidder from old auction which is replaced by new bidder from new auction (from the same tokenId) will get 0 `amount` because the `currentBid` is 0, then `vaultPayment` will equal to `amount`, thus the `lastBidderRefund` will be 0.
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
109:     uint256 vaultPayment = (amount - currentBid);
110: 
111:     if (firstBidTime == 0) {
112:       auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
113:     } else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
114:       uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
115:       _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
116:     }

```

## Impact
Existing Auction will be overwritten, if a bidder already participate in the Auction, then it will be overwritten, top/last bidder will lost their spot and asset.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
On `createAuction()` need to check if the auction of `tokenId` is active (because there might be a condition where the auction is being cancelled, and want to start a new auction). Or we can just check if currentBid of the auction of tokenId is not 0, then it should not be executed.
