# There are no checks or refunds for excessive payments in makePayment

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol/#L594](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol/#L594)

in the `_payment` function you check if the paymentAmount is higher than the lienAmount and subtract from the active lien amount after that

```solidity
if (lien.amount > paymentAmount) {
	lien.amount -= paymentAmount;
```

However, in the else block, you dont check for excessive paymentAmount, and transfer the full amount to the payee

```solidity
TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(WETH, payer, payee, paymentAmount);
```

### Impact

Some payers could, by mistake, make a payment with more funds than necessary and lose their tokens.

### Mitigation

Revert if the payment is more than the `lien.amount`, or return the excessive payment back to the `msg.sender`
