# makePayment doesnâ€™t divide the paymentAmount by the receiving liens

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol/#L397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol/#L397)

```solidity
function makePayment(uint256 collateralId, uint256 paymentAmount) public {
  _makePayment(collateralId, paymentAmount);
}
```

`makePayment` function inputs a paymentAmount

In the `_makePayment` function, the payment is made agains an array of liens. Notice that the `paymentAmount` is sent in full to all of the lien receivers in the loop

```solidity
uint256[] memory openLiens = liens[collateralId];
  uint256 paymentAmount = totalCapitalAvailable;
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < openLiens.length; ++i) {
    uint256 capitalSpent = _payment(
      collateralId,
      uint8(i),
      paymentAmount,
      address(msg.sender)
    );
```

Next, in the `_payment` function the full `paymentAmount` is removed from all liens and transferred to the payee.

```solidity
TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(WETH, payer, payee, paymentAmount);
```

This means that the caller funds will be potentially sent multiple times.

### Mitigation

Possibly divide the original `paymentAmount` with lien receivers, or make the payment for one specific lien only.
