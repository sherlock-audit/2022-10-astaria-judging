# Over payment should be returned

## Summary

In LienToken.sol, the `_payment()` function to repay the lien can accept more than the loan amount. If the borrower pay more than the loan amount by mistake, the fund is lost.


## Vulnerability Detail

The function only handle the case when the payment is less than `lien.amount`. But if the repay amount is bigger, the excess fund will not be returned to the borrower. This situation could happen since a mistakenly input decimal can inflate the amount by 10 times, or other input mistakes could possibly happen.


## Impact

Borrower might lose fund due to mistake.
