# _deleteLienPosition() function is public

## Summary

The `_deleteLienPosition()` function removes a lien from the system, along with all data associated with it. This function's visibility is set to `public`, so any user can remove any lien, eliminating their debts or the debts of others.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_deleteLienPosition()` function takes in a `collateralId` and a `position` and removes the lien at that position from the array of liens associated with that `collateralId`.

It appears this function was intended to be internal, as the function name begins with an `_` and it is called internally from the `_payment()` function.

However, the visibility is set to `public`, and it can therefore be called by any users.

## Impact

Any user can remove all their debt (or the debt of any other user) from the system.
