# Publicly Deletable Liens

## Summary

Lien positions represent tokenised debt upon loan origination. A third party may delete this lending data.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`LienToken._deleteLienPosition`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L651)

This function is used to delete lien positions. Anybody may call this function which deletes the debt to the collateral.

## Impact

- The data tracking lenders and debt is lost. Lenders will not get the capital they have lent.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _deleteLienPosition(uint256 collateralId, uint256 position) public {
    uint256[] storage stack = liens[collateralId];
    require(position < stack.length, "index out of bounds");

    emit RemoveLien(
      stack[position],
      lienData[stack[position]].collateralId,
      lienData[stack[position]].position
    );
    for (uint256 i = position; i < stack.length - 1; i++) {
      stack[i] = stack[i + 1];
    }
    stack.pop();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- This function is called from within the contracts and is prefixed with an underscore. Presumably this is intended to be an internal only function. If this is the case the function visibility can be changed to `internal`:

```solidity
function _deleteLienPosition(uint256 collateralId, uint256 position) internal {
```

- If the function is intended to be externally used ensure there is an appropriate modifier that prevents unauthorised third parties from modifying state.
