# PublicVault.sol doesn't override ERC4626Cloned.sol#mint allowing users to bypass router control of depositing

## Summary

`PublicVault.sol#deposit` specifically limits depositing to the `AstariaRouter.sol`. It inherits from `ERC4626Cloned` but never overrides the `mint` function, allowing users to directly mint with to the vault instead of through the `AstariaRouter.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail

PublicVault.sol - PublicVault

    function deposit(uint256 amount, address receiver)
      public
      override(Vault, ERC4626Cloned)
      whenNotPaused
      returns (uint256)
    {
      return super.deposit(amount, receiver);
    }

PublicVault.sol - Vault

    function deposit(uint256 amount, address)
      public
      virtual
      override
      returns (uint256)
    {
      require(msg.sender == owner(), "only the appraiser can fund this vault");
      ERC20(underlying()).safeTransferFrom(
        address(msg.sender),
        address(this),
        amount
      );
      return amount;
    }

`Vault#deposit` requires that the caller is the router. `ERC4626Cloned.sol#mint` accomplishes a similar goal to `deposit` but called with the number of shares instead of the amount of assets. `Deposit` is locked only to be accessed by the router but the sponsors forgot to override `mint` allowing users to directly mint to `PublicVault.sol`. This can lead to a large number of problems given how shares are valued. It can cause shares to be minted for unintended prices which can harm both current or minting users.

## Impact

Users can bypass router only minting, potentially causing loss of funds for themselves or current vault share holders

## Recommendation

Override `mint` to disable it or to limit call only to the router contract.
