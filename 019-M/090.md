# ecrecover missing address(0) check allows for fund draining, if the vault delegate is the 0 address

## Summary

It's possible to create a PublicVault that has the `delegate` field set to 0, if this happens all the funds of the vault can be drained because the return value of `ecrecover` is never checked to be different from address(0).

## Vulnerability Detail

The funds draining is possible due to a combination of:

- The `ecrecover` return at [VaultImplementation.sol#L167](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L167) never being checked to be different from `address(0)`
- The check `require(recovered == owner() || recovered == delegate)` at [VaultImplementation.sol#L183](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L183) passes if delegate is the 0 address.

## Impact

It's possible to make the vault accept any ERC721 compliant smart contract by passing a strategy with strategist set to address(0) and a ECSDA signature (v,r,s) of (0,0,0), or any random values. Meaning is possible to steal funds by landing worthless NFTs and having them liquidated.

## Code Snippet

Just copy-paste in `AstariaTest.t.sol`, run with `--via-ir` if necessary:

```solidity
  function testMakePaymentForMultipleLiens() public {
    // Dummy721 nft = new Dummy721();
    TestNFT nft = new TestNFT(1);
    address tokenContract = address(nft);
    uint256 tokenId = uint256(0);

    uint256 initialBalance = WETH9.balanceOf(address(this));

    /*

        Two vaults that accept TestNFT are available with liquidity

    */

    address publicVault = _createPublicVault({
      strategist: strategistOne,
      delegate: strategistTwo,
      epochLength: 14 days
    });

    address publicVault2 = _createPublicVault({
      strategist: strategistOne,
      delegate: strategistTwo,
      epochLength: 14 days
    });

    _lendToVault(
      Lender({addr: address(1), amountToLend: 50 ether}),
      publicVault
    );

    _lendToVault(
      Lender({addr: address(1), amountToLend: 50 ether}),
      publicVault2
    );

    /*

        ALICE takes two loans with TestNFT

    */

    uint256 firstLoanAmount = 100;
    uint256 secondLoanAmount = 10;
    // borrow 10 eth against the dummy NFT
    _commitToLien({
      vault: publicVault,
      strategist: strategistOne,
      strategistPK: strategistOnePK,
      tokenContract: tokenContract,
      tokenId: tokenId,
      lienDetails: standardLien,
      amount: firstLoanAmount,
      isFirstLien: true
    });

    _commitToLien({
      vault: publicVault2,
      strategist: strategistOne,
      strategistPK: strategistOnePK,
      tokenContract: tokenContract,
      tokenId: tokenId,
      lienDetails: standardLien,
      amount: secondLoanAmount,
      isFirstLien: false
    });

    /*
      
      ALICE repays her 110 wei debt with 150 wei

    */

    uint256 repayAmount = 150;

    uint256 collateralId = tokenContract.computeId(tokenId);
    assertEq(WETH9.balanceOf(address(this)), initialBalance + firstLoanAmount + secondLoanAmount);
    uint256 amount = firstLoanAmount + secondLoanAmount;
    vm.deal(address(this), repayAmount);
    WETH9.deposit{value: repayAmount}();
    WETH9.approve(address(TRANSFER_PROXY), repayAmount);
    WETH9.approve(address(LIEN_TOKEN), repayAmount);
    LIEN_TOKEN.makePayment(collateralId, repayAmount);

    /*
      
      ALICE tries to release her NFT but she can't because all of repayAmount
      has been considered as a payment for the first loan

    */

    vm.expectRevert("must be no liens or auctions to call this");
    COLLATERAL_TOKEN.releaseToAddress(collateralId, address(this));
  }
```

## Recommendation

At [VaultImplementation.sol#L167](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L167) require `recovered` to be different from `address(0)` .
