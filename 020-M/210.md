# Vault can be drained of funds via Signature replay.

## Summary
Due to the malleability issue in the use of ecrecover() for signature verification in VaultImplementation._validateCommitment(), users can replay a previous transaction and complete the request for a loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
VaultImplementation._validateCommitment() uses ecrecover() to verify the borrower's signature in the loan request. Due to the malleability of ecrecover() which is susceptible to replay attacks. It is possible to have another user replay the signature from a previous request to request for a loan over and over again.

## Impact
Loss of funds. Possible vault drain

## Code Snippet
```solitdity
address recovered = ecrecover(
      keccak256(
        encodeStrategyData(
          params.lienRequest.strategy,
          params.lienRequest.merkle.root
        )
      ),
      params.lienRequest.v,
      params.lienRequest.r,
      params.lienRequest.s
    );
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Avoid the use of malleable ecrecover(), instead use the OpenZepellin's ECSDA.recover() for signature verification
