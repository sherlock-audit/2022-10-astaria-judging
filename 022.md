# isValidRefinance checks both conditions instead of one, leading to rejection of valid refinances

## Summary

`isValidRefinance()` is intended to check whether either (a) the loan interest rate decreased sufficiently or (b) the loan duration increased sufficiently. Instead, it requires both of these to be true, leading to the rejection of valid refinances.

## Vulnerability Detail

When trying to buy out a lien from `LienToken.sol:buyoutLien()`, the function calls `AstariaRouter.sol:isValidRefinance()` to check whether the refi terms are valid.

```solidity
if (!ASTARIA_ROUTER.isValidRefinance(lienData[lienId], ld)) {
  revert InvalidRefinance();
}
```

One of the roles of this function is to check whether the rate decreased by more than 0.5%. From the docs:

> An improvement in terms is considered if either of these conditions is met:
> - The loan interest rate decrease by more than 0.5%.
> - The loan duration increases by more than 14 days.

The currently implementation of the code requires both of these conditions to be met:

```solidity
return (
    newLien.rate >= minNewRate &&
    ((block.timestamp + newLien.duration - lien.start - lien.duration) >= minDurationIncrease)
);
```

## Impact

Valid refinances that meet one of the two criteria will be rejected.

## Recommendation

Change the AND in the return statement to an OR:

```solidity
return (
    newLien.rate >= minNewRate ||
    ((block.timestamp + newLien.duration - lien.start - lien.duration) >= minDurationIncrease)
);
```
