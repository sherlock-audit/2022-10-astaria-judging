# in `_validateCommitment` the potentialDebt is calculated wrongly

## Summary
Users can almost never borrow twice (or more) with the same NFT, even if it's allowed by the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

At [VaultImplementation.sol#L221](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L221) the potential debt is calculated as:
```solidity
uint256 potentialDebt = seniorDebt * (ld.rate + 1) * ld.duration;
```
this multiplies the total debt of the NFT by `rate * duration` of the new lien, which makes `potentialDebt` higher value than expected in most situations.

## Impact

The variable `potentialDebt` can be higher than expected, making it almost impossible to pass the require:
at [VaultImplementation.sol#L222](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L222):
```solidity
require(potentialDebt <= ld.maxPotentialDebt)
```
not allowing users to borrow more than once, unlike described in the docs.

## Code Snippet
Here's the vulnerability:
```solidity
uint256 potentialDebt = seniorDebt * (ld.rate + 1) * ld.duration;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I'm not 100% confident what the calculation should be here, because I didn't test it. But intuitively it should be:
```solidity
uint256 potentialDebt = seniorDebt + (ld.rate + 1) * ld.duration + ld.amount;
```
which sums the maximum possible debt of the previous liens to the maximum potential debt of the new lien.
