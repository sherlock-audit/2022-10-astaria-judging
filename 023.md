# Checks for epoch lengths of new vaults are slightly off

## Summary

The check that new vaults has an `epochLength` in the range from `minEpochLength` (inclusive) to `maxEpochLength` (not inclusive) is slightly off.

## Vulnerability Detail

The error string for an incorrectly set epoch length reads:

> "epochLength must be greater than or equal to MIN_EPOCH_LENGTH and less than MAX_EPOCH_LENGTH"

However, in the code implementing this check, an `epochLength` equal to `maxEpochLength` is allowed.

```solidity
require(
  epochLength >= minEpochLength && epochLength <= maxEpochLength,
  "epochLength must be greater than or equal to MIN_EPOCH_LENGTH and less than MAX_EPOCH_LENGTH"
);
```

## Impact

Slightly longer epochs will be permitted than was intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the check in the require statement to match the intended behavior:

```solidity
require(
  epochLength >= minEpochLength && epochLength < maxEpochLength,
  "epochLength must be greater than or equal to MIN_EPOCH_LENGTH and less than MAX_EPOCH_LENGTH"
);
```
