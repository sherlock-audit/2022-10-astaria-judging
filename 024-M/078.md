# Reentrancy within flash action allows minting more collateral tokens

## Summary
There is no reentrancy protection for flash action, meaning the NFT can be deposited again.

## Vulnerability Detail
When someone takes out a flash action, he can redeposit the NFT as collateral (which will call `safeTransferFrom` and trigger `onERC721Received`), minting additional collateral token.

## Impact
More collateral tokens than intended are minted for a user.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not allow reentering, introduce a function for exiting the flash loan that does not trigger the `onERC721Received` logic.
