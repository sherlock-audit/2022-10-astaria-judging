# `yIntercept` is not correctly updated in `PublicVault.beforePayment()`

## Summary

Liquidity providers can't earn fees because `yIntercept` is not correctly updated in `PublicVault.beforePayment()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here's a scenario in which this happens:

1. A new vault is created
2. Bob lends 50ETH of liquidity to the new vault
3. Carol borrows 10ETH from the vault
5. Bob asks to redeem his shares from the vault
6. Carol pays back the 10ETH loan, fully
7. Epoch is processed and funds transferred to a withdrawProxy
8. Bob can now redeem less than 50ETH

The issue is at **6.**, at which point the slope for the lien is 0 but yIntercept does not get updated to reflect the paid interest.

## Impact

This leads to liquidity providers never earning fees and actually losing part of the liquidity provided in favour of the strategist.

## Code Snippet

Just copy-paste in `AstariaTest.t.sol`, run with `--via-ir` if necessary:

```solidity
function testWrongYInterceptAccoutingInBeforePayment() public {
    address alice = address(1);
    address bob = address(2);

    TestNFT nft = new TestNFT(1);
    address tokenContract = address(nft);
    uint256 tokenId = uint256(0);

    address publicVault = _createPublicVault({
      strategist: strategistOne,
      delegate: strategistTwo,
      epochLength: 14 days
    });

    uint256 bobAmountLend = 50 ether;
    uint256 aliceAmountLend = 50 ether;
    /*

        BOB lends 50ETH to publicVault

    */

    _lendToVault(Lender({addr: bob, amountToLend: bobAmountLend}), publicVault);

    /*

        CAROL borrows 10 ETH by providing an accepted NFT

    */

    IAstariaRouter.LienDetails memory customLien =
    IAstariaRouter.LienDetails({
      maxAmount: 50 ether,
      rate: 1000,
      duration: 10 days,
      maxPotentialDebt: 50 ether
    });

    _commitToLien({
      vault: publicVault,
      strategist: strategistOne,
      strategistPK: strategistOnePK,
      tokenContract: tokenContract,
      tokenId: tokenId,
      lienDetails: customLien,
      amount: 10 ether,
      isFirstLien: true
    });

    uint256 collateralId = tokenContract.computeId(tokenId);

    /*

        BOB asks to redeem his shares from the vault, which should be worth slightly more than 50ETH
        because of CAROL's partial loan payback

    */
    
    uint256 aliceShares = ERC20(publicVault).balanceOf(alice);
    uint256 bobShares = ERC20(publicVault).balanceOf(bob);

    vm.startPrank(bob);
    ERC20(publicVault).approve(publicVault, type(uint256).max);
    PublicVault(publicVault).redeemFutureEpoch({
      shares: bobShares,
      receiver: bob,
      owner: bob,
      epoch: 0
    });
    vm.stopPrank();

    address withdrawProxy = PublicVault(publicVault).withdrawProxies(
      PublicVault(publicVault).getCurrentEpoch()
    );

    /*

      CAROL pays back his 10ETH loan in full

    */

    WETH9.deposit{value: 10 ether * 2}();
    WETH9.approve(address(TRANSFER_PROXY), 10 ether * 2);
    WETH9.approve(address(LIEN_TOKEN), 10 ether * 2);
    LIEN_TOKEN.makePayment(collateralId, 10 ether * 2);

    /*

      Epoch is now over and a third party calls processEpoch to end the current epoch and
      transferWithdrawReserve to transfer BOB funds to the withdrawproxy

    */

    _warpToEpochEnd(publicVault);
    PublicVault(publicVault).processEpoch();
    PublicVault(publicVault).transferWithdrawReserve();

    /*

     BOB should now be able to exchange is shares for his 50ETH in liquidity plus a small fee accrued
     because of SOMEONE loan. It gets a way lower amount instead, netting him a big loss in funds.

    */

    vm.startPrank(bob);
    WithdrawProxy(withdrawProxy).redeem(
      ERC20(withdrawProxy).balanceOf(bob),
      bob,
      bob
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertGt(WETH9.balanceOf(bob), bobAmountLend);
    
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

At [PublicVault.sol#L433](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L433), increase `interceptY` by `amount`:

```javascript
...snip...
    if (lienSlope > slope) {
      slope = 0;
    } else {
      slope -= lienSlope;
    }
    
    yIntercept += amount; // !! <== adjust yIntercept

    last = block.timestamp;
...snip...
```
