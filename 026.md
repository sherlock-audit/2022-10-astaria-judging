# Payments made for all liens on a collateral token will only pay the first lien

## Summary

LienToken.sol has a function called `makePayment()` that allows a user to allocate a certain amount of capital to pay towards all the liens associated with a specific collateral token. However, the loop used in the function only pays the first lien, and doesn't send any funds to the others.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a function in the LienToken.sol contract that allows users to allocate capital towards all their liens:

```solidity
function makePayment(uint256 collateralId, uint256 paymentAmount) public...
```

This function runs a loop through the `openLiens` on that `collateralId`, and for each calls the following:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < openLiens.length; ++i) {
  uint256 capitalSpent = _payment(
    collateralId,
    uint8(i),
    paymentAmount,
    address(msg.sender)
  );
  paymentAmount -= capitalSpent;
}
```

The `_payment()` function returns the `paymentAmount` that is submitted to it unchanged. The result is that the `paymentAmount -= capitalSpent` is equivalent to `paymentAmount -= paymentAmount`, which will always equal 0.

The result is that, while the first iteration of the loop will pay the lien, all other iterations will be run with a `paymentAmount` of 0, which immediately returns without any action, and will therefore not transfer any funds towards paying off the lien:

```solidity
if (paymentAmount == uint256(0)) {
  return uint256(0);
}
```

## Impact

Users calling the `makePayment()` function with an amount that is greater than their first lien will expect all the funds used to go towards paying off their others liens, but only the first lien will be paid and others will remain with the full balance owed.

Here is the `_payment()` function, which never updates the value of `paymentAmount` before returning it:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `_payment()` function should return a value that is at most the amount of the lien, rather than the full `paymentAmount` offered.
