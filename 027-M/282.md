# Use safetransferFrom instead of transferFrom for NFT(ERC721) transfers

## Summary
The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom() in CollateralToken.sol file.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(), presumably to save gas. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

OpenZeppelin’s [documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of transferFrom(), use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible


## Impact
Given that any NFT can be used here, there are a few NFTs (here’s an example) that have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom()

## Code Snippet
[CollateralToken.sol#L176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L176)
[CollateralToken.sol#L223](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L223)
```solidity
  176:     nft.transferFrom(address(this), address(receiver), tokenId);
  223:     IERC721(underlyingAsset).transferFrom(address(this), releaseTo, assetId);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call the safeTransferFrom() method instead of transferFrom() for NFT transfers.
