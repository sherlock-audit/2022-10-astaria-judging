# Wrong calculation of newDuration in AuctionHouse.sol

## Summary
The value of `newDuration` for extended auction is calculated in a wrong way, resulting in very high numbers.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L135-L136

The new duration is calculated as `duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)`. If the auction is close to end, then `block.timestamp = duration+firstBidTime-x`, where `x` is some small number. Then:
`newDuration = duration + (duration+firstBidTime -x + timeBuffer - firstBidTime) = 2*duration + timeBuffer-x`. 

This bug is related to other found bug, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria-misoxxx/issues/3 - this bug will cause the value of `newDuration` to skyrocket, the second one will cause revert because of integer underflow. 
## Impact
The duration of auction is doubled. This is in direct contradiction with the comment, which says that duration should be only increased by `timeBuffer`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the formula to `newDuration = duration+timeBuffer`.
