# Incorrect calculation in `PublicVault.timeToEpochEnd()` causes loss of LP funds and lock of borrower collateral

## Summary

The `PublicVault.timeToEpochEnd()` function should calculate the seconds until the current epoch is over but is incorrectly implemented and so its usage in the liquidation flow breaks critical functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The implementation of `timeToEpochEnd()` appears to be the opposite of what the name/NatSpec suggests with: "Seconds until the current epoch ends" because it returns 0 at any point within the current epoch and the seconds after the current epoch has ended if we are in the next epoch. This causes its usage in `liquidate()` to execute the `if` part only when we are within the current epoch or within 2 days (auction window) of the next epoch. Beyond that, the `if` part is skipped.

## Impact

The liquidation flow will skip the critical aspects of `decreaseEpochLienCount()`, `deployLiquidationAccountant()`, `setPayee()` `handleNewLiquidation()` and `increaseLiquidationsExpectedAtBoundary()` under the conditions noted causing it to malfunction and resulting in loss of LP funds and lock of borrower collateral.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the implementation of `PublicVault.timeToEpochEnd()` to return `epochEnd - block.timestamp` or `0` depending on which of `epochEnd` or `block.timestamp` is greater.
