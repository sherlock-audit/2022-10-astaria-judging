# timeToEpochEnd is wrong

## Summary

The function `timeToEpochEnd` is implemented wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

From the comments and the usage, I believe `timeToEpochEnd` function is supposed to return the time left until the current epoch ends in seconds. But it's implemented wrong.

```solidity
function timeToEpochEnd() public view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 epochEnd = START() + ((currentEpoch + 1) * EPOCH_LENGTH());

  if (epochEnd >= block.timestamp) {
    //@audit should be <=
    return uint256(0);
  }

  return block.timestamp - epochEnd; //@audit should be epochEnd - block.timestamp
}

```

## Impact

From the usage (AstariaRouter #389), we can see that this function is very important in the liquidation and auction.
Because the current implementation will always return zero, this will generate a wrong expectation about the liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Fix the function `timeToEpochEnd` as below.

```solidity
function timeToEpochEnd() public view returns (uint256) {
  uint256 epochEnd = START() + ((currentEpoch + 1) * EPOCH_LENGTH());

  if (epochEnd <= block.timestamp) {
    return uint256(0);
  }
  return epochEnd - block.timestamp;
}

```
