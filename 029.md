# Incorrect Vault Exit Epoch Validation

## Summary

`redeemFutureEpoch()` is used within the vault to signal that the strategist wishes to withdraw in a future epoch. The redemption validation will accept the current epoch. The [documentation](https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/protocol-mechanics/epochs) and docstring states that this must be in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`PublicVault.redeemFutureEpoch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L185)

There is a check on line 185 to validate the withdrawal epoch is in the future. This is incorrect as it will allow the current epoch to be accepted as a withdrawal period.  

## Impact

- Liquidity providers may exit during the present epoch
- No loans will be able to be originated from this liquidity source 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
require(epoch >= currentEpoch, "Exit epoch too low");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Modify this check so that only epochs in the future are accepted:

```solidity
require(epoch > currentEpoch, "Exit epoch too low");
```
