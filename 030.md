# Non-Owners May Redeem From Public Vault

## Summary

`redeemFutureEpoch()` has a check to validate that the caller is the owner of the vault. This check erroneously validates a given function argument instead of the owner of the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`PublicVault.redeemFutureEpoch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L178)

Redemption requests to this function have a validation that the caller is the owner of the vault. The [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L187) validates a function argument instead of the vault owner. This means that anybody may call the function as long as they provide the correct function argument.

## Impact

- Non-owners of the vault may trigger redemptions

## Code Snippet

```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can redeem");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Modify this check to validate that the caller is the `owner()` and not a function argument:

```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner(), "Only the owner can redeem");
```
