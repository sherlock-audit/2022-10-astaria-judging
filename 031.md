# Leap Year Incorrect Interest Calculation

## Summary

The Astaria Router has a variable set at deploy time for the minimum interest rate basis point per-second. This value makes the assumption that each year has 365 days. During leap years this value is incorrect as there are 366 days in a year.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`AstariaRouter.constructor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L90)

At contract deploy time the interest rate in basis points per second is established. This `minInterestBPS` variable is calculated with the assumption that there are always 365 days in a year. This is not always true in the case of leap years, with the next one being in 2024.

## Impact

- As this variable is set statically and there is no setter to modify the value, any interest rate calculation such as [refinancing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L482) will return an interest rate one day shorter than it should be.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
minInterestBPS = uint256(0.0005 ether) / uint256(365 days); //5 bips / second
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider implementing a datetime library to account for years that do not have 365 days, or add a setter to be able to modify this value manually.
