# Underlying With Non-Standard Decimals Not Supported

## Summary

Arithmetic operations are performed with the assumption that the token always has 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`LiquidationAccountant.claim`
](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LiquidationAccountant.sol#L65)

Arithmetic operations assume the token has [18 decimals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LiquidationAccountant.sol#L78). Not all tokens use 18 decimals, such as Tether.

## Impact

- The addition of underlying capital that does not use 18 decimals will not be possible.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 transferAmount = withdrawRatio.mulDivDown(balance, 1e18);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider whether the addition of capital that does not use 18 decimals is desirable in the future. If it is, refactor contracts to support tokens with non-standard decimals.
