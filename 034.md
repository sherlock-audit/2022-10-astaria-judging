# Incorrect amount deducted from bidder

## Summary
The Auction bidder is always paying lesser than what he should be paying. This seems to be calculation mistake

## Vulnerability Detail
1. An auction is started with 1 bid of amount 1000
2. User A bids on this auction with amount 1500 using createBid function
3. Ideally User A should pay 1500 but end up only paying 500 due to below condition

```python
uint256 vaultPayment = (amount - currentBid);  // 1500-1000=500
_handleIncomingPayment(tokenId, vaultPayment, address(msg.sender)); // ask User A to transfer 500 instead of 1500 amount
```

4. This becomes bigger problem if now User B bids with amount say 2000 since this will trigger refund for User A which will be full amount 1500

```python
 uint256 vaultPayment = (amount - currentBid); // 2000-1500=500
uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment; // 2000-500=1500
      _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund); // Refund 500 to User A 
```

## Impact
Bidder will pay very low amount and will get higher amount if someone else bids on same auction
