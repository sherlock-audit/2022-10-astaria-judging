# Cancelled auction does not refund last bidder

## Summary
If the auction is cancelled then the last bidder is not paid causing immediate losses

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Auction A1 exists on which User A has bidded 2000 amount
2. Now this auction is cancelled using cancelAuction function

```python
function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
    external
    requiresAuth
  {
    require(
      auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
    );
    _handleIncomingPayment(
      auctionId,
      auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      canceledBy
    );
    _cancelAuction(auctionId);
  }
```

3. As we can see the last bidder is not refunded

## Impact
User funds as last bid will be lost once auction is cancelled
