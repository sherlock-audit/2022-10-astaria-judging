# Underflow will occur

## Summary
Contract will fail to create bid if user is below timeBuffer due to underflow

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the createBid function

```python
if (firstBidTime + duration - block.timestamp < timeBuffer) {
      uint64 newDuration = uint256(
        duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)
      ).safeCastTo64();
      if (newDuration <= auctions[tokenId].maxDuration) {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = newDuration;
      } else {
        auctions[tokenId].duration =
          auctions[tokenId].maxDuration -
          firstBidTime;
      }
```

2. Here auctions[tokenId].maxDuration is auctions[tokenId].duration+1 day
3. Now total auction duration is duration + firstBidTime which means duration will most likely be always lower than firstBidTime, which implies auctions[tokenId].maxDuration will also be < firstBidTime
4. But this means that auctions[tokenId].maxDuration-firstBidTime will fail with underflow

## Impact
Underflow attack causing user to be unable to bid on auction

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the new duration to maxDuration directly which will give just 1 day (although better to reduce maxDuration as user may keep on increasing auction by bidding at correct time)

```
auctions[tokenId].duration =auctions[tokenId].maxDuration
```
