# _validateCommitment() can be bypassed as 0 address is not checked on the return value of ecrecover

## Summary
`ecrecover()` returns 0 on invalid signature. See solidity docs https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=ecrecover#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions
This means that validateCommitment will not validate correctly in the case when `delegate == address(0)` as it can pass the required checks.

## Vulnerability Detail
`IAstariaRouter.Commitment calldata params` is a user input. Users can choose to input arbitrary data to pass required checks such as in the line, `require(recovered == params.lienRequest.strategy.strategist)`, the strategist can simply be set to `address(0)` and in the event that `delegate` address was not set, or set incorrectly, as we see that there is no check in `setDelegate()` that prevents it from being set to the 0 address, a user can bypass this signature verification.

## Impact
Users will be allowed to bypass the signature verification and make unexpected calls that they are not allowed to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require that the return value from `ecrecover` is not 0.
`require(recovered != address(0)`
