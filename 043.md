# AuctionHouse.createBid calculates next bid amount incorrectly

## Summary
`AuctionHouse.createBid` do not allow to provide `currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100)` value. The check only allows bigger amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
To create next bid user must increase previous bid by minBidIncrementPercentage, but such amount is reverted.
`AuctionHouse.createBid` checks amount for NFT in following way.

```solidity
require(
      amount > currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```

But is should also allow exact amount.

```solidity
require(
      amount >= currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```
## Impact
To create next bid user must increase previous bid by `minBidIncrementPercentage`, but such amount is reverted.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
require(
      amount > currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```

## Recommendation
Change to this.

```solidity
require(
      amount >= currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```
