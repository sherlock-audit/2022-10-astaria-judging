# liquidationAccountant can be claimed at any time

## Summary

New liquidations are sent to the `liquidationAccountant` with a `finalAuctionTimestamp` value, but the actual value that is passed in is simply the duration of an auction. The `claim()` function uses this value in a require check, so this error will allow it to be called before the auction is complete.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lien is liquidated, `AstariaRouter.sol:liquidate()` is called. If the lien is set to end in a future epoch, we call `handleNewLiquidation()` on the `liquidationAccountant`.

One of the values passed in this call is the `finalAuctionTimestamp`, which updates the `finalAuctionEnd` variable in the `liquidationAccountant`. This value is then used to protect the `claim()` function from being called too early.

However, when the router calls `handleLiquidationAccountant()`, it passes the duration of an auction rather than the final timestamp:

```solidity
LiquidationAccountant(accountant).handleNewLiquidation(
  lien.amount,
  COLLATERAL_TOKEN.auctionWindow() + 1 days
);
```
As a result, `finalAuctionEnd` will be set to 259200 (3 days). 

When `claim()` is called, it requires the final auction to have ended for the function to be called:

```solidity
require(
  block.timestamp > finalAuctionEnd || finalAuctionEnd == uint256(0),
  "final auction has not ended"
);
```
Because of the error above, `block.timestamp` will always be greater than `finalAuctionEnd`, so this will always be permitted. 

## Impact

Anyone can call `claim()` before an auction has ended. This can cause many problems, but the clearest is that it can ruin the protocol's accounting by decreasing the Y intercept of the vault. 

For example, if `claim()` is called before the auction, the returned value will be 0, so the Y intercept will be decreased as if there was an auction that returned no funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adjust the call from the router to use the ending timestamp as the argument, rather than the duration:

```solidity
LiquidationAccountant(accountant).handleNewLiquidation(
  lien.amount,
  block.timestamp + COLLATERAL_TOKEN.auctionWindow() + 1 days
);
```
