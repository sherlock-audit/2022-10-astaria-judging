# Strategists are paid 10x the vault fee because of a math error

## Summary

Strategists set their vault fee in BPS (x / 10,000), but are paid out as x / 1,000. The result is that strategists will always earn 10x whatever vault fee they set.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever any payment is made towards a public vault, `beforePayment()` is called, which calls `_handleStrategistInterestReward()`.

The function is intended to take the amount being paid, adjust by the vault fee to get the fee amount, and convert that amount of value into shares, which are added to `strategistUnclaimedShares`.

```solidity
function _handleStrategistInterestReward(uint256 lienId, uint256 amount)
    internal
    virtual
    override
  {
    if (VAULT_FEE() != uint256(0)) {
      uint256 interestOwing = LIEN_TOKEN().getInterest(lienId);
      uint256 x = (amount > interestOwing) ? interestOwing : amount;
      uint256 fee = x.mulDivDown(VAULT_FEE(), 1000);
      strategistUnclaimedShares += convertToShares(fee);
    }
  }
```
Since the vault fee is stored in basis points, to get the vault fee, we should take the amount, multiply it by `VAULT_FEE()` and divide by 10,000. However, we accidentally divide by 1,000, which results in a 10x larger reward for the strategist than intended.

As an example, if the vault fee is intended to be 10%, we would set `VAULT_FEE = 1000`. In that case, for any amount paid off, we would calculate `fee = amount * 1000 / 1000` and the full amount would be considered a fee for the strategist.

## Impact

Strategists will be paid 10x the agreed upon rate for their role, with the cost being borne by users.

## Recommendation

Change the `1000` in the `_handleStrategistInterestReward()` function to `10_000`.
