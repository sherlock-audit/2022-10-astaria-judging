# Rates can be set below minInterestBPS

## Summary

The router has a value `minInterestBPS` which is intended to set a minimum baseline for interest rates for vaults, but it is not incorporated into the vault's logic, so vault's can set interest rates below this threshold.

## Vulnerability Detail

In AstariaRouter.sol, the `minInterestBPS` variable is intended to set a minimum baseline interest rate (in BPS) that vaults can use. It is set in the constructor as:

```solidity
minInterestBPS = uint256(0.0005 ether) / uint256(365 days); // 5 bips / second
```
When commitments are checked in the vault, rather than confirming that the rate chosen is above this rate, we simply check that it is greater than zero:

```solidity
require(
  ld.rate > 0,
  "Vault._validateCommitment(): Cannot have a 0 interest rate"
);
```

## Impact

This circumvents the minimum threshold, allowing vaults to set a lower interest rate than intended.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the requirement to ensure that the rate is set higher than `minInterestBPS`:

```solidity
require(
    ld.rate > IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).minInterestBPS(),
    "Vault._validateCommitment(): Rate is below minimum"
);
```
