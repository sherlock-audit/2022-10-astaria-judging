# CollateralToken should allow to execute token owner's action to approved addresses also

## Summary
CollateralToken currently allows to execute actions related to NFT, only for the owner of token. But according to ERC721 it should allow them to approved addresses as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
`CollateralToken` functions [`flashAction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L159), [`releaseToAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L209-L212),  [`cancelAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L331) are restricted to the owner of token only. But they should be allowed for approved addresses as well.

Also, pls, note that it's allowed for operators to borrow [on behalf](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/VaultImplementation.sol#L152-L158) of owner.
## Impact
Approved operators can't call functions on behalf of owner.

## Recommendation
Add ability for approved operators to call functions.
