# `commitToLiens()` The run failed due to insufficient gas

## Summary
`commitToLiens()` The run failed due to insufficient gas
## Vulnerability Detail
`safeTransferFrom() `is called by `_transferAndDepositAsset()` and `TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom()` is called by the function itself.
These operations cost a lot of gas, but the functions have no constraints on their commitments length
## Impact
`commitToLiens()` The run failed due to insufficient gas
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L249-L274
```solidity
  function commitToLiens(IAstariaRouter.Commitment[] calldata commitments)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 totalBorrowed)
  {
    totalBorrowed = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < commitments.length; ++i) {
      _transferAndDepositAsset(
        commitments[i].tokenContract,
        commitments[i].tokenId
      );
      totalBorrowed += _executeCommitment(commitments[i]);

      uint256 collateralId = commitments[i].tokenContract.computeId(
        commitments[i].tokenId
      );
      _returnCollateral(collateralId, address(msg.sender));
    }
    WETH.safeApprove(address(TRANSFER_PROXY), totalBorrowed);
    TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(
      address(WETH),
      address(this),
      address(msg.sender),
      totalBorrowed
    );
  }
```

## Recommendation
1. Limit your commitments
2. Record the failed indexes
