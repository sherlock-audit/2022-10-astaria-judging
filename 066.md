# LienToken.createLien doesn't check if user should be liquidated and provides new loan

## Summary
`LienToken.createLien` doesn't check if user should be liquidated and provides new loan if auction do not exist for collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
`LienToken.createLien` [relies](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L244-L246)  on `AuctionHouse` to check if new loan can be added to borrower. It assumes that if auction doesn't exist then user is safe to take new loan.

The problem is that to start auction with token that didn't pay the debt someone should call `AstariaRouter.liquidate` function. If no one did it then auction for the NFT will not exists, and `LienToken.createLien` will create new Lien to user, while he already didn't pay debt and should be liquidated.
## Impact
New loan will be paid to user that didn't repay previous lien.

## Recommendation
Check if user can be liquidated through all of his liens positions. If not then only proceed with new loan.
