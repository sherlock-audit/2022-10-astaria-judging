# nlrType type is not signed by strategist, which could allow fraudulent behavior as new types are added

## Summary

The strategist signs the merkle root, their nonce, and the deadline of all strategies to ensure that new borrowers meet their criteria. However, the lien type (`nlrType`) is not signed. Currently, the structs for the different types are unique, so there is no ability to borrow one type as another, but if struct schemas of different types overlap in the future, this will open the door for exploits.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new lien is requested, the borrower submits a Lien Request, which is filled with the parameters at which they would like to borrow. This is kept honest and aligned with the lenders intent because the merkle root, strategist nonce, and deadline are all signed by the strategist.

Because the merkle root is signed, the borrower must submit lien parameters (`nlrDetails`) that align with one of the strategies that the strategist has chosen to allow (represented as leaves in the merkle tree). The schemas of these signed structs differ depending on the validator being used, which is defined in the `nlrType` parameter.

Currently, each of the validators has a unique schema for their struct. However, if there is an overlap in the schema of the Details struct of multiple validators, where the different parameters represent different values, it opens the door to having a fraudulent lien accepted.

Here's an example of how this might work:
- Type A has a Details struct with the shape { uint8 version, bool requirementX, IAstariaRouter.LienDetails lien }. 
- The lender includes in their merkle tree the following { version: 1, requirementX: true, lien: { ... maxAmount: 1 ether ... }
- Type B has a Details struct with the shape { uint8 version, bool requirementY, IAstariaRouter.LienDetails lien }
- The lender includes in their merkle tree the following strategy: { version: 1, requirementY: true, lien { ... maxAmount: 1 ether ... }
- The lender signs a merkle root including both of these strategies
- A borrower who meets requirementX but not requirementY could submit `lienDetails` with `nlrType = Type A` and send the validation to the wrong strategy validator, thus bypassing the expected checks

## Impact

As more strategy types are added, conflicts in struct schemas could open the door to fraudulent behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include the `nlrType` in the data signed by the strategist. The easiest way to do this would be to pack it in with each leaf when assembling the leaves that will create the merkle tree:

```solidity
function assembleLeaf(ICollectionValidator.Details memory details, address nlrType)
  public
  pure
  returns (bytes memory)
{
  return abi.encode(details, nlrType);
}

function validateAndParse... {
  ...
  leaf = keccak256(assembleLeaf(cd, params.nlrType));
}
```
