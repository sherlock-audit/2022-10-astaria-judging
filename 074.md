# AuctionHouse._handleIncomingPayment do not send interest to lien

## Summary
AuctionHouse._handleIncomingPayment do not send interest to lien
## Vulnerability Detail
When someone creates bid on auction then `AuctionHouse._handleIncomingPayment` function is called. It then send payments to lien's vaults one by one.

```solidity
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < liens.length; ++i) {
        uint256 payment;
        uint256 lienId = liens[i];

        ILienToken.Lien memory lien = LIEN_TOKEN.getLien(lienId);

        if (transferAmount >= lien.amount) {
          payment = lien.amount;
          transferAmount -= payment;
        } else {
          payment = transferAmount;
          transferAmount = 0;
        }

        if (payment > 0) {
          LIEN_TOKEN.makePayment(tokenId, payment, lien.position, payer);
        }
      }
```

The problem is that it uses `lien.amount` as value that should be sent as payment to LienToken. But it also should send interests, that were accrued for a lien.
## Impact
LienToken owner is underpaid with interests.

## Recommendation
Consider `lien.amount + LIEN_TOKEN.getInterest(lienId)` as full amount for LienToken payment.
