# maxPotentialDebt can be exceeded due to faulty calculation

## Summary

When a new lien is taken, the formula that checks if the new debt level will exceed `maxPotentialDebt` does not include the new debt amount taken on, which allows borrowers to take debt against a piece of collateral that the lender despite not being allowed by the lender's strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new lien is taken, part of the requirements are that this lien does not push the total amount borrowed above the `maxPotentialDebt` set by the strategy.

Currently, this is checked in the `AstariaRouter.sol:validateCommitment()` function as follows:

```solidity
uint256 seniorDebt = IAstariaRouter(ROUTER())
  .LIEN_TOKEN()
  .getTotalDebtForCollateralToken(
    params.tokenContract.computeId(params.tokenId)
  );

...

uint256 potentialDebt = seniorDebt * (ld.rate + 1) * ld.duration;
require(
  potentialDebt <= ld.maxPotentialDebt,
  "Vault._validateCommitment(): Attempting to initiate a loan with debt potentially higher than maxPotentialDebt"
);
```
This check takes the existing debt on the collateral, and multiplies it by the new rate and duration. However, it does not account for the increased amount of debt that will exist after the loan has been taken.

## Impact

New loans can be taken that exceed the explicitly set `maxPotentialDebt` in the strategy.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adjust the formula to accurately capture the new total debt amount. 

```solidity
uint256 potentialDebt = seniorDebt + params.lienRequest.amount * (ld.rate + 1) * ld.duration;
```
