# cancelAuction can be used to steal tokens from users

## Summary
With `cancelAuction`, a transfer (from the transfer proxy) with an arbitrary from address can be initiated.

## Vulnerability Detail
With `cancelAuction`, a transfer (from the transfer proxy) with an arbitrary from address can be initiated. This is done by passing the corresponding `canceledBy` address, which will call `_handleIncomingPayment`, which calls the transfer proxy to perform the transfer. Note that the transfer proxy must be approved for many parts of the system. A malicious actor can therefore call `cancelAuction` directly after an approval.

## Impact
The tokens of the user are lost. He approved the transfer proxy for some other action, but the approval was used to cancel an auction.
