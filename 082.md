# NFT not transferred in AuctionHouse.cancelAuction

## Summary
When an auction is cancelled, the NFT should be transferred back to the creator, but this is not done.

## Vulnerability Detail
`cancelAuction` only calls `handleIncomingPayment` and `_cancelAuction`. The latter only emits an event and deletes the auction, but does not transfer the NFT back (which should be done according to the description).

## Impact
The NFT will be lost.

## Recommendation
Transfer the NFT back to the auction creator.
