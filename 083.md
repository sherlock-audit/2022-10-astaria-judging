# LiquidationAccountant.claim may revert for some tokens

## Summary
`LiquidationAccountant.claim` may initiate a transfer with the amount 0, which reverts for some tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (e.g., LEND -> see https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers) revert when a transfer with amount 0 is initiated. This can happen within `claim` when the `withdrawRatio` is 100%.

## Impact
In such a scenario, the funds are not claimable, leading to a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not initiate a transfer when the amount is zero.
