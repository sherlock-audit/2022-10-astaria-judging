# Vault: Unprotected mint / redeem function

## Summary
`Vault` only protects the `deposit` / `withdraw` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within `Vault`, the `deposit` / `withdraw` functions are only callable by the owner. However, because the contracts inherits from ERC4626, there are also `mint` and `redeem` functions which are callable by anyone.

## Impact
Anyone can fund and exit the vault, which should not be possible for private vaults.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Also overwrite the `mint` and `redeem` functions.
