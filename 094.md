# The function buyoutLien always revert

## Summary
The function `buyoutLien` at [LienToken.sol#L121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L121) will always revert because `buyoutFeeDenominator` is never set.

## Vulnerability Detail

This happens because:

1. `buyoutLien` calls `getBuyout` at [LienToken.sol#L368](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L368)
2. `getBuyout` calls `getBuyoutFee` at [AstariaRouter.sol#L450](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L450)
3. `getBuoytFee` executes `remainingInterestIn.mulDivDown(buyoutFeeNumerator, buyoutFeeDenominator);`

however both `buyoutFeeNumerator` and `buyoutFeeDenominator` are setted to 0, as they're never intialized and there's no way to initialize them.

## Impact

Users are never allowed to refinance their loans.

## Code Snippet

Here's where to revert happens:
```solidity
  function getBuyoutFee(uint256 remainingInterestIn)
    external
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return
      remainingInterestIn.mulDivDown(buyoutFeeNumerator, buyoutFeeDenominator);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function that initializes `buyoutFeeNumerator` and `buyoutFeeDenominator` on AstariaRouter deployment.
