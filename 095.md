# VAULT_FEE() getter returns from the wrong offset, returning a wrong fee

## Summary 

The getter for the vault fee returns the wrong value, because the offset used is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AstariaVaultBase` in `ERC4626-Cloned.sol` we have the code:

```javascript
  function VAULT_TYPE() public view returns (uint8) {
    return _getArgUint8(164);
  }

  function VAULT_FEE() public view returns (uint256) {
    return _getArgUint256(172);
  }
```

`_getArgUint256` and `_getArgUint8` both takes as inputs a number of bytes, `VAULT_TYPE` is an `uint8` which means it occupies 1 byte but `VAULT_FEE` implementation `_getArgUint256(172)` is offsetted by 8 bytes instead of 1, meaning it returns a looking-random value which depends on the bytecode.

## Impact

The strategist could earn more fees than it should, substratcing the amount to liquidity providers which end up making less than they should, and potentially losing on the liquidity provided.

## Code Snippet

Here's the vulnerability code:

```solidity
  function VAULT_FEE() public view returns (uint256) {
    return _getArgUint256(172);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `VAULT_FEE()` to:

```javascript
  function VAULT_FEE() public view returns (uint256) {
    return _getArgUint256(165); //<==  165 instead of 172
  }
```
