# `transferFrom` is used instead of `safeTransferFrom` for transfer of ERC721 tokens

## Summary
Collateral tokens are sent without checking if `IERC721Receiver` is implemented when the recipient is a contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`transferFrom` is used to transfer collateral tokens, which doesn't check if the recipient is a contract. if the recipient is a contract, it would need to implement `IERC721Receiver` to signal that it can receive ERC721 tokens safely. If this is not the case ERC721 tokens could be lost.
Additionnaly, the recipient could have logic in the `onERC721Received` function that would not be executed using `transferFrom`.
 
## Impact
- ERC721 tokens could be lost in a non `IERC721Receiver` implementer contract.
- Critical logic present in the `onERC721Received` function of the recipient contract could be left not executed upon receiving a ERC721 token.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    COLLATERAL_TOKEN.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, collateralId);
```

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom`.
