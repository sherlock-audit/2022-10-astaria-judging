# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom when doing NFT transfers

## Summary
safeTransferFrom should always be used over transferFrom especially when NFT we are interacting with is arbitrary.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(). This isn’t recommended because:
1. [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of transferFrom(), use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible.
2. Given that any NFT can be used as a collateral, there are a few NFTs (here’s an [example](https://github.com/sz-piotr/eth-card-game/blob/master/src/ethereum/contracts/ERC721Market.sol#L20-L31)) that have logic in the onERC721Received() function, which is only triggered in the safeTransferFrom() function and not in transferFrom().

## Impact
NFT can be permanently lost if such an NFT is used as the collateral.
