# Can't bid less then the total loan amount

## Summary

When a bidder tries to bid less then total loan amount + fees, the bid is reverted because of arithmetic overflow. This forces bidders to only submit bids that are higher than the loaned amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The auction tries to repay the loan to the LienToken. Because the amount paid is smaller then the `lien.amount`, following branch is used:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L623-L629

This branch then sets `lien.last` to current block timestamp. Because current timestamp is higher than `end` of loan, this leads to arithmetic overflows in interest calculations.

## Impact
The first bidder is forced to repay the loan fully. If the value of collateral went slightly under the value of loan, the bidders have no incentive to participate in the auction and the loans won't be repayed.

## Code Snippet
Following POC showcases the bug:
```solidity
  function testAuctionCancel() public {
    Dummy721 nft = new Dummy721();
    address tokenContract = address(nft);
    uint256 tokenId = uint256(1);
    address publicVault = _createPublicVault({
      strategist: strategistOne,
      delegate: strategistTwo,
      epochLength: 14 days
    });

    _lendToVault(
      Lender({addr: address(1), amountToLend: 50 ether}),
      publicVault
    );

    uint256 vaultTokenBalance = IERC20(publicVault).balanceOf(address(1));

    _commitToLien({
      vault: publicVault,
      strategist: strategistOne,
      strategistPK: strategistOnePK,
      tokenContract: tokenContract,
      tokenId: tokenId,
      lienDetails: standardLien,
      amount: 10 ether,
      isFirstLien: true
    });

    uint256 collateralId = tokenContract.computeId(tokenId);

    _signalWithdraw(address(1), publicVault);

    address withdrawProxy = PublicVault(publicVault).withdrawProxies(
      PublicVault(publicVault).getCurrentEpoch()
    );

    assertEq(vaultTokenBalance, IERC20(withdrawProxy).balanceOf(address(1)));

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 14 days); // end of loan

    ASTARIA_ROUTER.liquidate(collateralId, uint256(0));

    address liquidationAccountant = PublicVault(publicVault)
      .liquidationAccountants(0);

    assertTrue(
      liquidationAccountant != address(0),
      "LiquidationAccountant not deployed"
    );

    _bid(address(2), collateralId, 10 ether);

  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The timestamp `lien.last` should not be increased above `lien.start + lien.duration`.
