# `FlashAction` can be used to re-take a loan against the same collateral

## Summary
Users can use `FlashAction` to take a loan using that same collateral NFT.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FlashAction` allows the user to unlock their underlying collateral and perform any action with the NFT as long as it is returned within the same block.

The issue is that they can use that NFT to take a new loan:

If the attacker contract implements`receiver.onFlashAction` so that it calls `AstariaRouter.commitToLiens`, this will result in srtarting a new loan, and transferring the NFT to the `COLLATERAL_TOKEN` contract.
At the end of the call, the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L193-L196) that the NFT is returned will hence pass.

## Impact
This new loan uses the same collateral as the previous one, meaning the user effectively took this new loan for free

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the underlying balance of the vault in `flashAction()`, ensuring it has not changed at the end of the call.
