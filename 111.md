# createBid will revert for all calls if extended duration is greater than max duration

## Summary

When an auction is bid on and the remaining time in an auction is less than a specified buffer, the auction will automatically be extended to prevent auctions from being sniped at the last minute. To prevent the auction from going on forever the auction can only be extended up to an additional 24 hours. The logic that occurs when the new extended duration is longer than the max duration is incorrect and will result in the transaction reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail

    newAuction.maxDuration = (duration + 1 days).safeCastTo64();

In `AuctionHouse.sol#createAuction` the `maxDuration` is set to the `duration` plus 1 day.

    if (firstBidTime + duration - block.timestamp < timeBuffer) {
      uint64 newDuration = uint256(
        duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)
      ).safeCastTo64();
      if (newDuration <= auctions[tokenId].maxDuration) {
        auctions[tokenId].duration = newDuration;
      } else {
        auctions[tokenId].duration =
          auctions[tokenId].maxDuration -
          firstBidTime;
      }
      extended = true;
    }

In `AuctionHouse.sol#createBid` if `newDuration > auctions[tokenId].maxDuration` then `auctions[tokenId].duration = auctions[tokenId].maxDuration - firstBidTime;`. This statement is almost guaranteed to fail. Assuming the auction is initially set to 86400 (1 day) then `maxDuration` would be 172800. Subtracting firstBidTime, which was the `block.timestamp` that the auction started, will underflow and revert.

## Impact

Final bids of an auction will unexpectedly fail, causing NFT to be sold for less than it otherwise would have

## Recommendation

Change the logic to set `duration = auctions[tokenId].maxDuration`
