# [NAZ-M2] Incorrect Logic Comparison

## Summary
`timeToEpochEnd()` is a function that tries to `"Computes the time until the current epoch is over"` then it returns `"Seconds until the current epoch ends"`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently it calculates the `epochEnd` and compares it to the `block.timestamp`. When it does this comparison it checks `if (epochEnd >= block.timestamp)` to return 0 and `block.timestamp - epochEnd;` elsewise. The logic here is wrong and should be returning 0 when `(epochEnd <= block.timestamp)` and `block.timestamp - epochEnd;` elsewise.

## Impact
Would cause unwanted reverts and possible protocol failures.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider fixing the logic error in the comparison for it to return the correct values.
