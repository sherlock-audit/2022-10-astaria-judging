# Funds are not refunded to current bidder in `cancelAuction(...)` function

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L210-L224

Function `cancelAuction(...)` does not refunded to current bidder, cause loss of funds for current bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `cancelAuction(...)` is used by NFT owner to cancel an on-going auction by paying reserve price. In case `currentBid` is already larger than `reservePrice` then the auction cannot be cancelled.

However, in `cancelAuction(...)`, it received `reservePrice` from `canceledBy` by calling `_handleIncomingPayment(...)` function and then cancel the auction but do not refund anything to current bidder. Current bidder will lose the fund he bid before. 

## Impact

Loss of funds for current bidder. 

## Code Snippet

Normally, when a new bid is placed, it should refund the last bidder 
```solidity
if (firstBidTime == 0) {
  auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
} else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
  uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
  _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
}
```

However, in case auction is cancelled, last bidder will lose the bidden funds because `cancelAuction(...)` function does not refund last bidder. 
```solidity
function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
  external
  requiresAuth
{
  require(
    auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
    "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
  );
  _handleIncomingPayment( // @audit fund are not returned to current bidder ?
    auctionId,
    auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
    canceledBy
  );
  _cancelAuction(auctionId);
}
```
