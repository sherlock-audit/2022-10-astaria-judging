# Bug #1 - Incorrect `newDuration` calculation cause auction extending to `maxDuration` every time

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L135-L137

Incorrect `newDuration` calculation cause auction extending to `maxDuration` every time.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `createBid(...)`, if the difference between timestamp and auction expired time smaller than `timeBuffer`, it will be extended (at most 1 day). In that case, the `newDuration` should be

```python
newDuration = duration + timeToAdd
  = duration + (timeBuffer - timeRemaining)
  = duration + (timeBuffer - (expectedEnd - block.timestamp))
  = duration + (timeBuffer - ((firstBidTime + duration) - block.timestamp))
  = block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime
```

However, the calculation in the codebase is 
```solidity
newDuration = duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)
```
which mean `newDuration` is much larger than expected (apx 2 times). It cause the `newDuration` always set to `maxDuration` assuming that `duration > 1 days`

## Impact

Incorrect `newDuration` calculation cause auction extending to `maxDuration` every time.

## Code Snippet

Lines of code for `newDuration` calculation. The proof of concept is given in the Vulnerability Detail section.
```solidity
uint64 newDuration = uint256(
  duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime) // @audit wrong calculation of newDuration
).safeCastTo64();
```

## Recommendation

Consider updating the formula to calculate `newDuration`
