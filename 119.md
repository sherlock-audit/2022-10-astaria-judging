# MultiRolesAuthority is capable of draining all user's fund after user gives token allowance to TransferProxy.sol

## Summary

MultiRolesAuthority is capable of draining all user's fund after user given token allowance to TransferProxy.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

When centralization risk is easily out of scope, I feel like it is very worth submitting the issue as medium.

The TransferProxy.sol is important because it helps moving the fund around in AuctionHouse, AstariaRouter and in LienToken.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/TransferProxy.sol#L18-L32

As we can see, this function below is powerful. It is likely that user will give the max WETH allowance to the contract TransferProxy, otherwise, transaction would revert in AuctionHouse.sol, LienToken and in AuctionHouse.

```solidity
  function tokenTransferFrom(
    address token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
  ) external requiresAuth {
    ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount);
  }
```

Well, note that the requiresAuth modifier is used in the function tokenTransferFrom, this access control model means that only specific address set up by admin can call this function.

The relevant permision is granted in deploy.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/scripts/deployments/Deploy.sol#L80-L81

and then

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/scripts/deployments/Deploy.sol#L172-L176

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/scripts/deployments/Deploy.sol#L187-L191

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/scripts/deployments/Deploy.sol#L204-L208

Ok the relevant permission is properly granted, no contract is under-privileged and no contract is over-privileged,

but still, this does not stop a malicious admin manager that controlls MultiRolesAuthority to authorize a evil contract that can drain all the WETH fund from user by calling 

```solidity
  function tokenTransferFrom(
    address token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
  ) 
```

## Impact

User's WETH can be drained by malicious admin.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only use safeIncreaseAllowance to give minimum approval to move the fund around, use multisig to safeguard to admin address for 
MultiRolesAuthority, check balanceOf before and balanceOf after to make sure the target receive the fund after calling tokenTransferFrom from TransferProxy.sol.

Again, it is likely that centralization risk / compromised admin is out of scope, please take this very serious because the user's fund is at stake.
