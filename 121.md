# Auction duration is not 48H

## Summary
The duration of the auction can be set arbitrary, not 48H
found by [Tomosuke0930](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Vulnerability Detail
Docs says as follows
https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/protocol-mechanics/liquidations
> Auction lengths are set to 48 hours, but bids near the deadline will extend the auction up to a hard deadline beyond the initial auction end.

## Impact
However, the duration of the auction can be set arbitrarily length by auction creators.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L67-L85
```solidity
function createAuction(
    /* ... */		
    uint256 duration,
    /* ... */		

  ) external requiresAuth returns (uint256 reserve) {

    (reserve, ) = LIEN_TOKEN.stopLiens(tokenId);

    Auction storage newAuction = auctions[tokenId];
    newAuction.duration = duration.safeCastTo64();
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the duration is 2 days, not an arbitrary length, or change the documentation.
