# Does not support Cryptopunks

## Summary
This protocol doesn't support cryptopunks

## Vulnerability Detail
Cryptopunks is a most famous NFT collection.
By not supporting the trading of cryptopunks, it is a severe situation when compared to other protocols. Cryptopunks have their own internal marketplace which allows users to trade their NFTs to other users.

As such, cryptopunks don't follow the ERC721 standard, it will always fail when the protocol attempts to trade them.

Here is an example [implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L417-L424).

```solidity
} else if (assetAddr == punks) {
// CryptoPunks.
// Fix here for frontrun attack. Added in v1.0.2.
bytes memory punkIndexToAddress = abi.encodeWithSignature("punkIndexToAddress(uint256)", tokenId);
(bool checkSuccess, bytes memory result) = address(assetAddr).staticcall(punkIndexToAddress);
(address owner) = abi.decode(result, (address));
require(checkSuccess && owner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
data = abi.encodeWithSignature("buyPunk(uint256)", tokenId);
```

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L578-L587
```solidity
function _transferAndDepositAsset(address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId)
    internal
  {
    IERC721(tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(
      address(msg.sender),
      address(COLLATERAL_TOKEN),
      tokenId,
      ""
    );
  }
```
