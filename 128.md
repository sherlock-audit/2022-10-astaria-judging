# `buyoutLien` functionality can end up in a DoS state if non-standard ERC20 token is used

## Summary
Some non-standard ERC20 tokens always force users to approve to zero first, otherwise they revert. The code does not follow this, so it can result in a DoS state.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functionality in `VaultImplementation.sol` for `buyoutLien` has the following code `    ERC20(underlying()).safeApprove(
      address(IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).TRANSFER_PROXY()),
      buyout
    );`
The problem is with [USDT](https://gist.github.com/plutoegg/a8794a24dfa84d0b0104141612b52977#file-tethertoken-sol-L265) as you can see in its approve function. USDT expects each call to approve to first zero out the allowance and only then you can change it. So if `underlying()` is USDT this functionality will always revert.

## Impact
In under certain circumstances (using USDT as underlying token in a vault) a core protocol functionality `buyoutLien()` will be in DoS state

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always approve to a value of zero first before approving to any other value, so basically before `    ERC20(underlying()).safeApprove(
      address(IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).TRANSFER_PROXY()),
      buyout
    );` you should do `    ERC20(underlying()).safeApprove(
      address(IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).TRANSFER_PROXY()),
      0
    );`
