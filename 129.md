# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom

## Summary
Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
The `receiver` will receive the COLLATERAL_TOKEN as NFT when `_returnCollateral` is called.
However, if `receiver` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the COLLATERAL_TOKEN can be frozen in the contract.
```solidity
  function _returnCollateral(uint256 collateralId, address receiver) internal {
    COLLATERAL_TOKEN.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, collateralId);
  }
```
As per the documentation of EIP-721:
> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Recommendation
Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` like [this](https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L581-L586).
```solidity
/// before
function _returnCollateral(uint256 collateralId, address receiver) internal {
    COLLATERAL_TOKEN.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, collateralId);
  }

/// after
function _returnCollateral(uint256 collateralId, address receiver) internal {
  IERC721(COLLATERAL_TOKEN).safeTransferFrom(
   (address(this), 
   receiver,
   collateralId,
   ""
   );
  }
```
