# When using solmate, check the contract has existed

## Summary
If you use solmate, you should check the token contract has existed.
found by [Tomosuke093](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Vulnerability Detail
> Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.

Ref: https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9

However, there is no checking.

## Impact
Therefore, if users send a token that does not exist, the system may not work properly because it returns true

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/TransferProxy.sol#L25-L32
```solidity
function tokenTransferFrom(
    address token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
  ) external requiresAuth {
  // @audit-issue this underlying is a contract check
    ERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(from, to, amount);
  }
```

https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/LiquidationAccountant.sol#L65-L97
```solidity
function claim() public {
    require(
      block.timestamp > finalAuctionEnd || finalAuctionEnd == uint256(0),
      "final auction has not ended"
    );

    uint256 balance = ERC20(underlying()).balanceOf(address(this));
    // would happen if there was no WithdrawProxy for current epoch
    if (withdrawRatio == uint256(0)) {
  // @audit-issue this underlying is a contract check
      ERC20(underlying()).safeTransfer(VAULT(), balance);
```
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/ERC4626-Cloned.sol#L305-L322

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, address)
    public
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "only the appraiser can fund this vault");
    // @audit-issue this underlying is a contract check

    ERC20(underlying()).safeTransferFrom(
      address(msg.sender),
      address(this),
      amount
    );
    return amount;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should check contract has existed like this
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L36-L42
```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    // This method relies on extcodesize/address.code.length, which returns 0
    // for contracts in construction, since the code is only stored at the end
    // of the constructor execution.

    return account.code.length > 0;
}
```
