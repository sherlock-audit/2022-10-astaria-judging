# Doesn't support rebasingToken

### Finder

## Summary
User will lose their reward if the token is rebasing token.

## Vulnerability Detail
If rebasing tokens are used as the `underlying()` token, rewards accrue to the vault and cannot be withdrawn by either the option seller or the owner, and remain locked forever.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/ERC4626-Cloned.sol#L305-L322
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, address)
    public
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "only the appraiser can fund this vault");
    ERC20(underlying()).safeTransferFrom(
      address(msg.sender),
      address(this),
      amount
    );
    return amount;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track total amounts currently deposited and allow vault creators to withdraw an excess on a pro-rata basis
