# Can't call this function before epoch ended

## Summary
Can't call this function before epoch ended

## Vulnerability Detail
The comment says as follows
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L236-L238
```solidity
/**
  * @notice Rotate epoch boundary. This must be called before the next epoch can begin.
*/
```
However, this function can call the after `currentEpoch` ended
```solidity
require(getEpochEnd(currentEpoch)  < block.timestamp, "Epoch has not ended");
```
### Example
If the `currentEpoch` is 3.
`getEpochEnd(currentEpoch)` will be as follows.
```solidity
START() + 4 * EPOCH_LENGTH()
```
And block.timestamp has to be bigger than this value to pass this check. Therefore, this function can call when the epoch enters into 4.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L236-L249
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Rotate epoch boundary. This must be called before the next epoch can begin.
   */
  function processEpoch() external {
    // check to make sure epoch is over
    require(getEpochEnd(currentEpoch) < block.timestamp, "Epoch has not ended");
    require(withdrawReserve == 0, "Withdraw reserve not empty");
    if (liquidationAccountants[currentEpoch] != address(0)) {
      require(
        LiquidationAccountant(liquidationAccountants[currentEpoch])
          .getFinalAuctionEnd() < block.timestamp,
        "Final auction not ended"
      );
    }
```
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L473-L475
```solidity
function getEpochEnd(uint256 epoch) public view returns (uint256) {
    return START() + (epoch + 1) * EPOCH_LENGTH();
}

```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should change as follows to implement like the comment.
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Rotate epoch boundary. This must be called before the next epoch can begin.
*/
function processEpoch() external {
 // check to make sure epoch is over
 require(getEpochEnd(currentEpoch - 1) < block.timestamp, "Epoch has not ended");
  /* ... */
}
```
