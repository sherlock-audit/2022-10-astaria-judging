# ERC4626 does not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
The ERC4626.deposit/mint functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the amount variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the totalAssets do not include the fee anymore.

This can be abused to mint more shares than desired.

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC4626-Cloned.sol has the following code
```jsx
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
    public
    virtual
    override(IVault)
    returns (uint256 shares)
  {
    // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
    require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    ERC20(underlying()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

    _mint(receiver, shares);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);

    afterDeposit(assets, shares);
  }
```
If the vault is using a fee-on-transfer as an underlying token here is what happens:
A deposit(1000) should result in the same shares as two deposits of deposit(500) but it does not because amount is the pre-fee amount.
Assume a fee-on-transfer of 20%. Assume current totalAmount = 1000, totalShares = 1000 for simplicity.

deposit(1000) = 1000 / totalAmount * totalShares = 1000 shares
deposit(500) = 500 / totalAmount * totalShares = 500 shares. Now the totalShares increased by 500 but the totalAssets only increased by (100% - 20%) * 500 = 400. Therefore, the second deposit(500) = 500 / (totalAmount + 400) * (newTotalShares) = 500 / (1400) * 1500 = 535.714285714 shares.
In total, the two deposits lead to 35 more shares than a single deposit of the sum of the deposits.

## Impact
This vulnerability can result in malicious users getting more shares than they should have gotten when doing mint/deposit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `deposit()` `assets` should be the amount excluding the fee, i.e., the amount the contract actually received.
This can be done by subtracting the pre-contract balance from the post-contract balance.
