# LiquidityProvider can also lend to PrivateVault

## Summary
Insufficient access control for lending to PublicVault
found by [yawn-c111](https://github.com/yawn-c111)

## Vulnerability Detail
Docs says as follows
https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/intro
> Any strategists may provide their own capital to fund these loans through their own `PrivateVaults`, and whitelisted strategists can deploy `PublicVaults` that accept funds from other liquidity providers.

However, Liquidity Providers can also lend to `PrivateVault`.

This is because `lendToVault` function is controlled by `mapping(address => address) public vaults`, which are managed by `_newVault` function and include `PrivateVault`s

This leads to unexpected atttack.

## Impact 
Unexpected liquidity providers can lend to private vaults

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L324

```solidity
function lendToVault(IVault vault, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(
      address(WETH),
      address(msg.sender),
      address(this),
      amount
    );

    require(
      vaults[address(vault)] != address(0),
      "lendToVault: vault doesn't exist"
    );
    WETH.safeApprove(address(vault), amount);
    vault.deposit(amount, address(msg.sender));
  }
```

```solidity
function _newVault(
    uint256 epochLength,
    address delegate,
    uint256 vaultFee
  ) internal returns (address) {
    uint8 vaultType;

    address implementation;
    if (epochLength > uint256(0)) {
      require(
        epochLength >= minEpochLength && epochLength <= maxEpochLength,
        "epochLength must be greater than or equal to MIN_EPOCH_LENGTH and less than MAX_EPOCH_LENGTH"
      );
      implementation = VAULT_IMPLEMENTATION;
      vaultType = uint8(VaultType.PUBLIC);
    } else {
      implementation = SOLO_IMPLEMENTATION;
      vaultType = uint8(VaultType.SOLO);
    }

    //immutable data
    address vaultAddr = ClonesWithImmutableArgs.clone(
      implementation,
      abi.encodePacked(
        address(msg.sender),
        address(WETH),
        address(COLLATERAL_TOKEN),
        address(this),
        address(COLLATERAL_TOKEN.AUCTION_HOUSE()),
        block.timestamp,
        epochLength,
        vaultType,
        vaultFee
      )
    );

    //mutable data
    VaultImplementation(vaultAddr).init(
      VaultImplementation.InitParams(delegate)
    );

    vaults[vaultAddr] = msg.sender;

    emit NewVault(msg.sender, vaultAddr);

    return vaultAddr;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
create requirement to lend to only PublicVaults.
