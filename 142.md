# DoS by infinite `PublicVault`

### Finder 
[Tomosuke0930](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Summary
It happens denial of service because there are infinite vault

## Vulnerability Detail
Docs says as follows
https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/smart-contracts/PublicVault
> `PublicVaults` are operated by supported strategists. Any user may become a liquidity provider and supply capital to a `PublicVaults` in exchange for yield-bearing ERC-4626 VaultTokens

Therefore, each `PublicVault` will show the front end to allow users to become liquidity providers.

However, the PublicVault has no access control and no limit to the quantity.

Finally, there will be numerous malicious `PublicVault` displayed to actual users.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
/**
   * @notice Deploys a new PublicVault.
   * @param epochLength The length of each epoch for the new PublicVault.
   */
  function newPublicVault(
    uint256 epochLength,
    address delegate,
    uint256 vaultFee
  ) external whenNotPaused returns (address) {
    //@audit-issue you should restrict access  ここでtypeがくるよね
    // https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/smart-contracts/PublicVault
    return _newVault(epochLength, delegate, vaultFee);
  }
```

```solidity
function _newVault(
    uint256 epochLength,
    address delegate,
    uint256 vaultFee
  ) internal returns (address) {
    uint8 vaultType;

    address implementation;
    if (epochLength > uint256(0)) {
      require(
        epochLength >= minEpochLength && epochLength <= maxEpochLength,
        "epochLength must be greater than or equal to MIN_EPOCH_LENGTH and less than MAX_EPOCH_LENGTH"
      );
      implementation = VAULT_IMPLEMENTATION;
      vaultType = uint8(VaultType.PUBLIC);
    } else {
      implementation = SOLO_IMPLEMENTATION;
      vaultType = uint8(VaultType.SOLO);
    }

    //immutable data
    address vaultAddr = ClonesWithImmutableArgs.clone(
      implementation,
      abi.encodePacked(
        address(msg.sender),
        address(WETH),
        address(COLLATERAL_TOKEN),
        address(this),
        address(COLLATERAL_TOKEN.AUCTION_HOUSE()),
        block.timestamp,
        epochLength,
        vaultType,
        vaultFee
      )
    );

    //mutable data
    VaultImplementation(vaultAddr).init(
      VaultImplementation.InitParams(delegate)
    );

    vaults[vaultAddr] = msg.sender;

    emit NewVault(msg.sender, vaultAddr);

    return vaultAddr;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a modifier to allow only whitelisted strategists to create a public vault
