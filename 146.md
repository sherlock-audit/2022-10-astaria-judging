# No refund token for bidder if canceled

## Summary
`lastBidder` will loss their funds because there is no refund system for `cancelAuction`
found by [Tomosuke0930](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Vulnerability Detail
There is an auction. This auction.reservePrice is 10 WETH.
1. Alice pays 5 WETH as a first bidder
2. The unexpected situation happens and `the` non-malicious owner executes `cancelAuction`
3. This check will pass like this
```ts
    require(
                        /*    5 WETH < 10 WETH   */
      auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
    );
```
4. And, there is no refund system for this function to last bidder
5. Finally, Alice will be lost 5 WETH

## Impact
`lastBidder` will loss their funds without mechanism for refund

```solidity
function cancelAuction(uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner(tokenId) {
    require(AUCTION_HOUSE.auctionExists(tokenId), "Auction doesn't exist");

    AUCTION_HOUSE.cancelAuction(tokenId, msg.sender);
  }
```

```solidity

function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
    external
    requiresAuth
  {
    require(

      auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
    );
    // @audit-info to pay the amount of auctions.reserve by canceledBy
    _handleIncomingPayment(
      auctionId,
      auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      canceledBy 

    );
    _cancelAuction(auctionId);
  }
```

```solidity
function _cancelAuction(uint256 tokenId) internal {
    emit AuctionCanceled(tokenId);
    delete auctions[tokenId];
  }
```
