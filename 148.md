# Wrong way to use transferFrom and approve

### Finder 
[Tomosuke0930](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Summary
The `makePayment` transaction may return a revert due to insufficient allowances

## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom function needs the allowance from sender to the caller. 
In this context, it is needed the allowance from `payer` to `TRANSFER_PROXY`
However, there is no checking allowances from the `payer` to `TRANSFER_PROCY`. 
Therefore, if the allowances are insufficient, this `tokenTransferFrom` method will be failed silently.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L426-L433

```solidity
  function makePayment(
    uint256 collateralId,
    uint256 paymentAmount,
    uint8 position,
    address payer
  ) public requiresAuth {
    _payment(collateralId, position, paymentAmount, payer);
  }
```

https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/LienToken.sol#L594-L649

```solidity
  function _payment(
    uint256 collateralId,
    uint8 position,
    uint256 paymentAmount,
    address payer
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    /* ... */
    //@audit-issue  no check allowances
    TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(WETH, payer, payee, paymentAmount);

  }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the `payer` is not necessarily the msg.sender, check the allowances from `payer` to `TRANSFER_PROXY`.
