# No slippage tolerance

## Summary
No slippage tolerance leads to user funds loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
`previewWithdraw` function is used to decide the amount of `shares` before withdrawing it. 
This function calculates the result using the value at the time the function is called. Therefore, it is easy to manipulate prices with front-running.

### Example
1. Alice execute `withdraw` to withdraw their provided funds
2. Eve detects this transaction and sends the transaction to deposit a large amount to this contract.
3. And, the value of `totalAssets()` will be large.
4. Therefore, in the transaction of Alice, the amount of `share` will be smaller than Alice expected.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L161-L168
```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
  ) public virtual override returns (uint256 shares) {
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    redeemFutureEpoch(shares, receiver, owner, currentEpoch);
  }
```

```solidity
function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets)
    public
    view
    virtual
    returns (uint256)
  {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply(); // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

    return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivUp(supply, totalAssets());
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let users can set the minAmount to prevent this attack.
```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner,
    uint256 minAmount
  ) public virtual override returns (uint256 shares) {
    shares = previewWithdraw(assets);
    require(shares > minAmount, "TOO_SMALL_SHARES");
    redeemFutureEpoch(shares, receiver, owner, currentEpoch);
  }
```
