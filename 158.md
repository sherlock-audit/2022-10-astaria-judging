# Auction time extension in `createBid()` is calculated wrongly

## Summary
`duration` is increased by more than it should be. In the AuctionHouse contract, there are 2 comments that tells us how duration should be added.
1. "extend 15 minutes after every bid made in last 15 minutes"
2. "if the difference is less than the timeBuffer, increase the duration by the timeBuffer"

This tells us that we only increase the duration by the `timeBuffer`, which is 15 minutes in our case when the remaining time till auction expires is less than 15 minutes. However, this is not how it is currently being added.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `if (firstBidTime + duration - block.timestamp < timeBuffer)` block, we are checking if the remaining time to expiration is less than `timeBuffer` and this is correct.

`newDuration` is then calculated as `newDuration = duration + (block.timestamp + timeBuffer - firstBidTime)`.
This is wrong as we are adding more time than needed for `newDuration`.

If the previous condition is met, we should only add time `timeBuffer` to duration, so the correct calculation is
`newDuration = duration + timeBuffer`.

## Impact
`duration` is being extended by more than intended which extends the auction end time in an unintended manner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `newDuration` to `newDuration = duration + timeBuffer`.
