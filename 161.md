# `_deleteLienPosition()` is lacking access control

## Summary
Anyone can call `_deleteLienPosition()` as it is a public function. This allows anyone to remove any lien position currently in place.

## Vulnerability Detail
Missing `requiresAuth` modifier in `function _deleteLienPosition(uint256 collateralId, uint256 position) public {}`

## Impact
Severity here is critical. Lien is a representation of a debt position created by users. Allowing anyone to delete any lien position should not be allowed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `requiresAuth` modifier to the function.
