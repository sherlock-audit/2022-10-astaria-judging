# `createAuction()` is lacking an important input verification - not checking that `initiator` is not the 0 address

## Summary
`createAuction()` is missing an important check here - that `initiator` address is not the 0 address. Note that this is an important check as assets are transferred to this address after an auction ends in certain situations.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `initiator` address is set to 0 and an auction ends with no bidder, the winner by default would be the `initiator`. In this case, `_releaseToAddress()` will be called which transfers the collateral to this address burning it hence resulting in a loss of asset.

## Impact
User can lose their asset if `initiator` address is set to the 0 address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the check `require(initiator == address(0)` in `createAuction()`.
