# Lack of access control in PublicVault.sol#transferWithdrawReserve let user call transferWithdrawReserve() multiple times to modify withdrawReserve

## Summary

Lack of access control in PublicVault.sol#transferWithdrawReserve let user call transferWithdrawReserve() multiple times to modify withdrawReserve

## Vulnerability Detail

The function PublicVault.sol#transferWithdrawReserve() is meants to transfers funds from the PublicVault to the WithdrawProxy.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L341-L363

However, this function has no access control, anyone can call it multiple times to modify the withdrawReserve value

## Impact

A malicious actor can keep calling the function transferWthdrawReserve() before the withdrawal proxy is created.

If the underlying proxy has address(0), the transfer is not performed, but the state withdrawReserves is decremented.

Then user can invoke this function to always decrement the withdrawReserve to 0

```solidity
    // prevent transfer of more assets then are available
    if (withdrawReserve <= withdraw) {
      withdraw = withdrawReserve;
      withdrawReserve = 0;
    } else {
      withdrawReserve -= withdraw;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add requiestAuth modifier to the function 

```solidity
  function transferWithdrawReserve() public {
```

We can also change the implementation by implmenting: if the underlying withdrawProxy is address(0), revert transfer.
