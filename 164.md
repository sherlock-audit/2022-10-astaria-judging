# `auctionExists()` is implemented in an unreliable way as an auction can exist but fail the check

## Summary
`auctionExists()` checks if an auction exist by checking if `auctions[tokenId].initiator != address(0)`. This is problematic as an auction can be created with `auctions[tokenId].initiator = address(0)` which bypasses this check.

## Vulnerability Detail
`auctionExists()` is used multiple times in both `CollateralToken.sol` and `LienToken.sol`. It is important that the function returns an accurate result. For example, `createLien()` can only be called if an auction exist, but in the case when `auctions[tokenId].initiator == address(0)`, this will revert even though auction is already created.

## Impact
Multiple parts of the protocol will not be able to function due to a wrong return result from `auctionExists()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this, we can either ensure that `initiator` cannot be the 0 address, or we can use a more reliable check - `auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime != 0`, since `firstBidTime` is always set to `block.timestamp`.

However, I recommend that both of these are implemented as `initiator` should not be the 0 address as mentioned in my other issue #8.
