# Triggering liquidations ahead of expected time leads to loss and lock of funds

## Summary

Triggering liquidations for a collateral after one of its liens has expired but before the auction window (default 2 days) at epoch end leads to loss and lock of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Liquidations are allowed to be triggered for a collateral if any of its liens have exceeded their loan duration with outstanding payments. However, the liquidation logic does not execute the decrease of lien count and setting up of liquidation accountant if the time to epoch end is greater than the auction window (default 2 days). The auction proceeds nevertheless.

## Impact

If liquidations are triggered before the auction window at epoch end, they will proceed to auctions without decreasing epoch lien count, without setting up the liquidation accountant for the lien and other related logic. This will, at a minimum, lead to auction proceeds going to lien owners directly instead of via the liquidation accountants (loss of funds) and the epoch unable to proceed to the next on (lock of funds and protocol halt).

## Recommendation

Revisit the liquidation logic and its triggering related to the auction window and epoch end.
