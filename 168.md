# Incorrect operator in `AstariaRouter.isValidRefinance` can lead to borrower loss and potential liquidation

## Summary

Incorrect use of operator `>=` instead of `<=` in `isValidRefinance()` can lead to borrower loss and potential liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The check in `isValidRefinance()` for `newLien.rate >= minNewRate` is incorrect because it allows the new lien's rate of interest to be greater than maximum new rate instead of it being lesser than that value. The calculation of `uint256(lien.rate) - minInterestBPS;` actually gives `maxNewRate` and not `minNewRate`.

## Impact

Refinancing is a crucial feature of the protocol to allow a borrower to refinance their loan if a certain minimum improvement of interest rate or duration is offered. This logical error allows a borrower to accidentally refinance or a malicious strategist to intentionally refinance an existing loan to a new one with a worse interest rate, leading to material loss for the borrower and potential liquidation in future.
