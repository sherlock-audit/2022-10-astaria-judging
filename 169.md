# Loans can exceed the maximum potential debt leading to vault insolvency and possible loss of LP funds

## Summary

Missing to account for the new lien can allow loans on a collateral to exceed maximum potential debt leading to vault insolvency and potential loss of LP funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LienToken.createLien` function tries to prevent loans and the total potential debt from surpassing the defined `params.terms.maxPotentialDebt` limit. When the `getTotalDebtForCollateralToken` function is called, the new lien (which will be created within this transaction) is not yet added to the `liens[collateralId]` array. However, the `getTotalDebtForCollateralToken` function iterates over this very same array and will return the total debt without considering the new lien being added and for which this check is being performed.

## Impact

The strategist's defined max potential debt limit can be exceeded, which changes/increases the risk for LPs, as it imposes a higher debt to the public vault. This could lead to vault insolvency and loss of LP funds.

Example exploit: Given a public vault and a lien with a max potential debt amount of 50 ETH (that's the default `standardLien` in TestHelpers.t.sol)

    1. 100 ETH have been deposited in the public vault by LPs
    2. Bob borrows 50 ETH with his 1st NFT -> success
    3. Bob borrows another 50 ETH with his 2nd NFT -> successful as well even though theirs a limit of 50 ETH 
    4. Bob now has 100 ETH -> The max potential debt limit is exceeded by 50 ETH

## Recommendation

Check the total debt limit after adding the new lien to the `liens[collateralId]` array.
