# Loan duration can exceed the end of the next epoch

## Summary

Loan duration can exceed the end of the next epoch, which deviates from the protocol specification.

## Vulnerability Detail

From the specs: "The duration of new loans is restricted to not exceed the end of the next epoch. For example, if a PublicVault is 15 days into a 30-day epoch, new loans must not be longer than 45 days."

However, there's no enforcement of this requirement. 

## Impact

The implementation does not adhere to the spec: Loan duration can exceed the end of the next epoch, which breaks protocol specification and therefore lead to miscalculations and potential fund loss.
