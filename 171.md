# Buyouts of shorter duration liens can lead to the loss of borrower funds

## Summary

Liens whose duration is equal to (or maybe less than) `minDurationIncrease` cannot be bought out to be replaced by newer liens with lower interest rates but the same duration. This locks the borrower out of better-termed liens, effectively resulting in the loss of their funds 
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Liens whose duration is equal to (or maybe less than) `minDurationIncrease` cannot be bought out to be replaced by newer liens with lower interest rates but the exact duration because it results in an underflow in `_getRemainingInterest()`.

Example scenario: if the strategy`liendetails.duration` is <= 14 days, then it's impossible to do a buyout of a new lien because the implemented check requires to wait `minDurationIncrease`, which is set to 14 days. However, if the buyer waits 14 days, the lien is expired, which triggers the earlier mentioned underflow.

## Impact

The borrower gets locked out of better-termed liens, effectively resulting in the loss of their funds because of extra interest paid on older liens.

Revisit the checking logic and minimum duration as it applies to shorter-duration loans.
