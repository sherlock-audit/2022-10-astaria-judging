# Payments and liquidations of multiple liens will revert and can be exploited, causing payer fund loss

## Summary

The `liens` array and its indexes are changed whenever a lien is fully paid back. Therefore, referencing liens by their position in the array is broken because indices change. Payments and liquidations of multiple liens within a loop will revert and can be exploited by sandwiching liens to force a payment to the attacker's lien.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever a lien position is fully paid back, the lien is deleted from the `liens` array. This means that the array is shortened and the indices of the remaining liens are changed. This is problematic when paying back liens in a loop because the indices of the remaining liens are changed which will cause revert with an index out-of-bounds error.

One can be exploited to pay for a different (attacker's) lien position because the lien array gets shortened when another payment (by the attacker or someone else) beforehand causes a deleted lien position.


## Impact

Liquidations of multiple liens and payments against a collateral token and all its liens will revert. This will result in the collateral NFT being locked forever.

**Exploit scenario:** A malicious junior debt holder can buy out a senior debt (sandwich the original borrower effectively) to trigger this sequence of actions. For e.g., if the `liens` array is [1, 5, 3] where the malicious junior lien holder of 3 also buys out 1 and front-runs the borrower's intended payment for 5 by repaying 1 and forcing the array to shorten to [5, 3] will make the borrower pay off their lien of 3 instead of borrower's lien of 5. Effectively, a lien holder can "force" a payment to their own lien instead of another one.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revisit and fix the entire logic that manages positions with the `liens` array addition, traversal and deletion.
