# Public vault depositors will receive fewer vault shares until the first payment

## Summary

Public vault total asset calculation is incorrect until the first payment, leading to depositors receiving fewer vault shares than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

As long as `PublicVault.last` is set to 0, the `PublicVault.totalAssets` function returns the actual ERC-20 token balance (WETH) of the public vault. Due to borrowing, this balance is reduced by the borrowed amount. Therefore, as there is no payment, this leads to depositors receiving fewer vault shares than expected.

## Recommendation

Revisit the logic behind updating `last` when `yIntercept` and/or `slope` are updated.
