# Minting public vault shares while the protocol is paused can lead to LP fund loss

## Summary

Assets can be deposited into public vaults by LPs with `PublicVault.mint` function to bypass a possible paused protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The PublicVault contract prevents calls to the `PublicVault.deposit` function while the protocol is paused by using the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

The `PublicVault` contract extends the `ERC4626Cloned` contract, which has two functions to deposit assets into the vault: the `deposit` function and the `mint` function. The latter function, however, is not overwritten in the PublicVault contract and therefore lacks the appropriate `whenNotPaused` modifier. 

## Impact

LPs can deposit assets into public vaults with the `PublicVault.mint` function to bypass a possible paused protocol. This can lead to LP fund loss depending on the reason for the protocol pause and the incident response.
