# Epochs can be progressed during ongoing auctions to cause LP fund loss and collateral lockup

## Summary

The `currentEpoch` can be progressed while having an ongoing auction which will completely mess up the liquidation logic to potentially cause LP fund loss and collateral lockup.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LiquidationAccountant.claim()` function is only callable if `finalAuctionEnd` is set to 0 or the  `block.timestamp` is greater than `finalAuctionEnd` (i.e. auction has ended). Furthermore, `PublicVault.processEpoch` should only be callable if there is *no* ongoing auction if a liquidation accountant is deployed in the current epoch.

`finalAuctionEnd` is set within the `LiquidationAccountant.handleNewLiquidation` function, which is called from the `AstariaRouter.liquidate` function. However, instead of providing a timestamp of the auction end, a value of `2 days + 1 days` is given because `COLLATERAL_TOKEN.auctionWindow()` returns `2 days`.

This does not achieve the intended constraint on checking for the end of the auction because it uses a fixed duration instead of a timestamp.

## Impact

Epochs can be progressed during ongoing auctions to completely mess up the liquidation logic to potentially cause LP fund loss and collateral lockup.
