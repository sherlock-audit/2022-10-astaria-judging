# Public vaults can become insolvent because LPs are allowed to withdraw in current epoch

## Summary

Public vaults can become insolvent because LPs are allowed to withdraw in the current epoch

## Vulnerability Detail

From https://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/smart-contracts/WithdrawProxy : "To ensure that PublicVaults always have sufficient funds to cover new loan originations, liquidity providers must signal that they wish to withdraw funds at least one epoch in advance."

From https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L184-L185, the check incorrectly uses `>=` instead of `>` thereby allowing LPs also to redeem/withdraw from `currentEpoch`. This breaks the protocol specification and constraints on vault solvency for the current epoch.

## Impact

LP's will be allowed to withdraw in the current epoch, which will make the vault insolvent towards new loan originations as documented.
