# Auction bid that partially pays back an expired lien will revert

## Summary

Auction bids will revert for a bid amount that does not fully pay back an expired lien.

## Vulnerability Detail

The value of `lien.last` is updated to `block.timestamp` in several parts of the code, even for expired liens. Payments made as part of liquidations will set `lien.last` to `block.timestamp` > `lien.start + lien.duration` causing a revert in the flow shown below at step 3 when it is subtracted from `end`:

1. `IPublicVault(lienOwner).afterPayment(lienId);`
2. `slope += LIEN_TOKEN().calculateSlope(lienId);`
3. `return (owedAtEnd - lien.amount).mulDivDown(1, end - lien.last);`

## Impact

Auction bids will revert for a bid amount that does not fully pay back an expired lien. If a lien is only partially paid back, it will reach the `if` branch in `LienToken._payment`, which sets `lien.last` to the current timestamp (which itself is `> lien.start + lien.duration`, hence the liquidation) and then revert.

This affects the economic efficiency of auctions because it DoS's partial bids and therefore results in loss of funds to LPs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revisit the logic that updates `lien.last` in the protocol to ensure no reverts in expected flows.
