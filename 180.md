# Lien buyout with new terms does not update the slope of public vaults

## Summary

Lien buyout with new terms does not update the slope of public vaults leading to reverts and potential insolvency of vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `VaultImplementation.buyoutLien` function, a lien is bought out with new terms. Terms of a lien (last, start, rate, duration) will have changed after a buyout. This changes the slope calculation, however, after the buyout, the slope for the public vault is not updated.

## Impact

There are multiple parts of the code affected by this.

1) When liquidating, the vault slope is adjusted by the liens slope (see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L385-L387). In case of a single lien, the PublicVault.updateVaultAfterLiquidation function can revert if the lien terms have changed previously due to a buyout (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L532). Hence, liquidations with a public vault involved, will revert.

2) The PublicVault contract calculates the implied value of a vault (ie. totalAssets) with the use of the slope value (see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L412). As the slope value can be outdated, this leads to undervalue or overvalue of a public vault and thus vault share calculations will be incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the slope of the lien before the buyout in the `VautImplementation.buyoutLien` function, subtract the calculated slope value from `PublicVault.slope`, update lien terms, recalculate the slope and add the new updated slope value to `PublicVault.slope`.
