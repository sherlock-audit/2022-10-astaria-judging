# A malicious lien buyer can DoS to cause fund loss/lock

## Summary

A malicious lien buyer can DoS to cause fund loss/lock of other lien holders & borrower collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call `buyoutLien` to purchase a lien token delivered to an arbitrary receiver. A malicious entity (even the borrower themselves) can purchase a small lien amount with its token delivered to their contract, which can implement `supportsInterface()` with arbitrary code, e.g. revert, that gets executed by the protocol in multiple places giving the attacker control at those points.

## Impact

1. An attacker can revert `endAuction()` to prevent the release of collateral to the winner.
2. An attacker can revert `liquidate()` to prevent the liquidation from even starting.
3. An attacker can revert `_payment()` to prevent any lien payments from succeeding in calls to `makePayment(uint256 collateralId, uint256 paymentAmount)`

Thus, a malicious lien buyer can DoS to cause fund loss/lock of other lien holders & loss/lock of borrower collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Maintain a mapping of active public vaults.
2. Account for malicious lien token owners via lien buyouts.
3. Use reentrancy guards.
