# Missing critical event emission may lead to late incident response or loss of user trust

## Summary

Missing critical event emission in `file` setter may lead to late incident response or loss of user trust.

## Vulnerability Detail

The generic `file` setter in `AstariaRouter` allows authorized roles to change critical protocol addresses/parameters (e.g. fees, epochs, implementations etc.) but is missing an event emission.

Other similar `file` setters have events emitted as expected.

## Impact

This could lead to late/missed critical protocol updates by users who could be surprised by address/parameter changes and thereby lose/withdraw capital, which will erode user trust in the protocol. If these changes are done by unauthorized entities (via key compromise/leaks) then the protocol team may lose critical time for incident response.
