# Strategy validator corruption can cause commitment validation flows to fail

## Summary

Unintended replacement of strategy validator can cause commitment validation flows to fail for all lien commits and buyouts.


## Vulnerability Detail

Strategy validators are maintained by the protocol using `mapping(uint16 => address) public strategyValidators;` that maps the validator `TYPE` to its address. The `TYPE` here is represented as a `uint16` instead of the corresponding `uint8 nlrType;`.

This allows the file setter to use `TYPE`'s greater than 255 but decodes it using: `(uint8 TYPE, address addr) = abi.decode(data, (uint8, address));`. If a `TYPE` > 255 is attempted then the decoding leads to an overflow and sets the incorrect `TYPE` to an incorrect address in `strategyValidators[TYPE] = addr;`. For instance, attempting to set with `TYPE` = 256 will instead set the address for `TYPE` = 1 to an incorrect value, thus corrupting it.

This depends on how many `strategyValidators` types the protocol expects to have. It is not specified/documented how many types are expected and so if we assume that the mapping is correct, then the `uint8` assumption in other parts of the code is incorrect.

## Impact

If the file setter is used to add `strategyValidators` for types > 255 then the potential corruption of existing strategy validators will cause commitment validation flows to fail for all related lien commits and buyouts, thus halting the protocol.

## Recommendation

Change declaration to `mapping(uint8 => address) public strategyValidators;` to specify that only types up to 255 will be allowed.
