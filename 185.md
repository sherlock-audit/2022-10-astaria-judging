# Auctions with remaining liens will always revert causing loss of funds for the highest bidder and stuck collateral

## Summary

Auctions with remaining liens can never be ended because they will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `endAuction` will always revert with `NOT_MINTED` error if there are any `liensRemaining` because the value passed to `LIEN_TOKEN.ownerOf` is `i` in the for loop instead of `liensRemaining[i]`.

## Impact

Auctions with remaining liens can never be ended leading to loss of funds for the highest bidder and stuck collateral.
