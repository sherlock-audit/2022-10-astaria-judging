# A malicious lien owner can exploit a reentrancy to steal LP funds

## Summary

A malicious lien owner can exploit a reentrancy in auctions to have their liens removed without making their payments and thus stealing LP funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious lien owner can exploit a reentrancy from the callback to `decreaseYIntercept()` in `endAuction()` to call `cancelAuction()` and then take a new loan whose lien token is removed when control returns back to `endAuction()`.

## Impact

PoC: https://gist.github.com/lucyoa/901a7713fded73293b5e4f9452344c5a

Exploit scenario sequence:
1. Strategist creates the public vault
2. Liquidity provider puts 50 ETH into vault
3. Malicious borrower takes a loan of 10 ETH by depositing NFT
5. Borrower buys out their own lien via `_buyoutLien` by paying 10ETH + fee
6. Borrower does not repay within lien duration to trigger liquidation
7. Borrower (or someone else) triggers `endAuction()`
9. Execution flow gets hijacked by borrower (lien token owner) inside call to `decreaseYIntercept()`:
    1.  Borrower cancels auction by paying `reservePrice`+`initiatorFee` (this would also go to borrower if `setPayee` is set before the auction as the owner of that Lien token)
    2. Borrower releases NFT to themselves
    3. Borrower now takes another loan of 50 ETH with the same NFT, vault and commitment
10. Once control returns to `AuctionHouse.endAuction`, borrower's new loan's Lien token is deleted
11. `CollateralToken.endAuction` releases borrower's NFT to borrower
12. Malicious borrower steals 50 ETH from vault without any outstanding liens resulting in LP fund loss

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Maintain a mapping of active public vaults.
2. Account for malicious lien token owners via lien buyouts.
3. Use reentrancy guards.
