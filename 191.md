# Any excess payment by the borrower towards a lien is not refunded leading to a loss of borrower funds

## Summary

Any excess payment by the borrower towards any particular lien is not refunded back to the payer but is entirely transferred to the payee.This results in a loss of borrower funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

A borrower can make a repayment towards their debt against a `CollateralToken` for a specific lien using `makePayment()`. However in the underlying `_payment()`, if the payment made is greater than `lien.amount` the excess amount paid is not refunded back to the payer but is entirely transferred to the payee.

## Impact

The borrower, who does not repay a precise amount (because of incorrect calculation), will lose the excess amount paid to the payee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `paymentAmount -= lien.amount` in the `else` block of `_payment()`.
