# Lien count per epoch is not updated ultimately locking the collateralized NFT

## Summary

The lien count per epoch is not updated, causing payments to the lien and liquidation of the lien to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The PublicVault contract keeps track of open liens per epoch to prevent starting a new epoch with open liens. The lien count for a given epoch is decreased whenever a lien is fully paid back (either through a regular payment or a liquidation payment). However, if a lien is bought out, the lien start will be set to the current `block.timestamp` and the duration to the newly provided duration.

If the borrower now wants to make a payment to this lien, the `LienToken._payment` function will evaluate the lien's current epoch and will use a different epoch as when the lien was initially created. The attempt to then call `IPublicVault(lienOwner).decreaseEpochLienCount` will fail, as the lien count for the new epoch has not been increased yet. The same will happen for liquidations.

## Impact

After a lien buyout, payments to the lien and liquidating the lien will revert, which will ultimately lock the collateralized NFT.

This will certainly prevent the borrower from making payments towards that future-epoch lien in the current epoch because `decreaseEpochLienCount()` will revert. However, even after the epoch progresses to the next one via `processEpoch()`, the `liensOpenForEpoch` for the new epoch still does not account for the previously bought out lien aligned to this new epoch because `liensOpenForEpoch` is only updated in two places:
    1.  `_increaseOpenLiens()` which is not called by anyone 
    2. `_afterCommitToLien()` <- `commitToLien()` <-- <-- `commitToLiens()` which happens only for new lien commitments

This will prevent the borrower from making payments towards the previously bought lien that aligns to the current epoch, which will force a liquidation on exceeding lien duration. Depending on when the liquidation can be triggered, if this condition is satisfied `PublicVault(owner).timeToEpochEnd() <= COLLATERAL_TOKEN.auctionWindow()` then `decreaseEpochLienCount()` will revert to prevent auctioning and lock the borrower's collateral in the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`liensOpenForEpoch` should be incremented when a lien is bought with a duration spilling into an epoch higher than the current one.
