# Canceling an auction will result in a loss of borrower funds towards initiator fees

## Summary

The initiator fee on the current bid has already been accounted during that bid but is expected to be paid again on cancellation by the borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider an active auction with a reserve price of 10 ETH and a current bid of 9 ETH. If the auction gets canceled, the `transferAmount` will be 10 ETH. Once the cancellation logic adds repayment to current bidder (see other finding reported on this issue), the initiator fees for cancellation should only be calculated on the delta payment of 1 ETH because the fees for the earlier 9 ETH bid has already been paid to the initiator. However, this is not accounted and requires the borrower to pay the initiator fees on the entire reserve price leading to overpayment towards the initiator and loss of funds for the borrower.

## Impact

Canceling an auction will require paying (a lot) more initiator fees than needed resulting in a loss of funds for the borrower.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The cancellation amount required should be the reserve price + liquidation fee, where the fee is calculated on `(reserve price - current bid)` and not the reserve price.
