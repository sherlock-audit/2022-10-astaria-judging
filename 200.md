# Enforcing the maximum auction duration fails, leading in potential loss of funds to LPs

## Summary

Enforcing the maximum auction duration fails for auctions with a duration of more than 1 day (default `auctionWindow` is 2 days).

## Vulnerability Detail

The `newDuration` calculation logic will revert due to an underflow in `auctions[tokenId].maxDuration - firstBidTime;` because `firstBidTime` is a timestamp while `maxDuration` is a duration.

## Impact

This prevents bids within the last 15 mins of auctions thereby reducing the auction window and any higher bids that would have happended in that time. This potentially leads to lower auction payouts to LPs resulting in loss of their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the `else` logic to `auctions[tokenId].duration =  auctions[tokenId].maxDuration`.
