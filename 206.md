# Users can mint Collateral Token free without transferring ERC721 underlying asset.

## Summary
A user is able to call onERC721Received() of the CollateralToken contract and mint collateral tokens without transferring underlying asset to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralToken.onERC721Received() is expected to mint a new CollateralToken wrapping for an NFT after receiving the NFT asset in a callback after a sender calls safeTransferFrom() in the underlying asset NFT contract. However, it is possible for a user to call the CollateralToken.onERC721Received() directly in a malicious contract without transferring any NFT and the user mints a CollateralToken.

With this CollateralToken, the user would be able to take out loans and even start Auctions.

## Impact
Potential loss of ERC20 token assets from Vaults

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L266-L296

1. Alice can deploy contract A that makes the following call:
     ```solidity
      ICollateralToken(CTAddress).onERC721Received(aliceAddress, aliceAddress, 1, "")
     ```
2. Alice's contract receives the minted collateral token and is able to create an auction for it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply necessary logic that would check that the CollateralToken contract has actually received the underlying asset before minting a collateral token.
