# Use safeTransferFrom Instead of transferFrom for ERC721 transfers

## Summary
ERC721.transferFrom() does not check whether the receiving address know how to handle ERC721 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In CollateralToken.releaseToAddress() , the internal call _releaseToAddress() transfers the undelyingasset for the collaterId and transfers from the CollateralToken contract to the `releaseTo` address. If the `releaseTo` is a contract and not aware of incoming ERC721 tokens, the sent token could be locked up in the contract forever.

Use of transferFrom method for ERC721 transfer is discouraged and recommended to use safeTransferFrom
whenever possible by OpenZeppelin.
This is because transferFrom() cannot check whether the receiving address know how to handle ERC721 tokens.

## Impact
Loss of ERC721 token

```solidity
function _releaseToAddress(uint256 collateralId, address releaseTo) internal {
    (address underlyingAsset, uint256 assetId) = getUnderlying(collateralId);
    IERC721(underlyingAsset).transferFrom(address(this), releaseTo, assetId);
    delete idToUnderlying[collateralId];
    _burn(collateralId);
    emit ReleaseTo(underlyingAsset, assetId, releaseTo);
  }
```
1. Assume owns a collateralToken.
2. ContractA exists for an economic reason.
3. ContractA does not implement  onERC721Received()
4. Alice  makes a call to CollateralToken.releaseToAddress(collaterTokenId, contractAaddress)
5. ERC721 token is locked and Alice loses token.
