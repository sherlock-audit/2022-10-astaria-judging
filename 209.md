# Vault can be drained of funds using arbitrary commitment input when Private vault delegate is 0.

## Summary
When a Private Vault delegate is address(0) , a user with a Collateral Token can request for any arbitrary amount in the loan request, using user-crafted Commitment input and possibly drain the Vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the delegate for the initialized VaultImplementation contract is address(0), any user can craft a Commitment input and request for a lone and pass all necessary checks, especially the require check for the ecrecover() result of the signature verification in VaultImplementation._validateCommitment(). With this, user can be paid any amount inputted in the loan request.

## Impact
Loss of funds. Possible vault draint

## Code Snippet
1. If Vault had been created with address(0) in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L280-L282 , then Private Vault contract would be initialized with delegate as address(0).

2. Fred calls AstariaRouter.commitToLiens() with crafted commitment input.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L249-L274
3. The call to borrow `c.lienRequest.amount` in  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/AstariaRouter.sol#L570 would pass and the Router contract would receive the requested amount from the private vault specified in the commitment input
5. Fred would be transferred the amount of WETH requested.
 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply checks for zero address input when initializing the vault. Additionaly, avoid the use of malleable ecrecover().
