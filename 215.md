# Protocol fee should be taken before creating a lien token

## Summary

Protocol fee should be taken before creating a lien, or else a borrower needs to pay more debt than reasonable.

## Vulnerability Detail

Normally when we say about borrowing, it is reasonable to charge the interest against the actually borrowed amount.
In the current implementation, debt is tracked using the LienToken and the protocol fee is taken after that.
So the borrower needs to repay the additional interest for the protocol fee as well.
For example, let us say the protocol takes 10% fee and a user borrows 60 eth with an interest rate 20%/week.
Then a lien token is created with amount of 60 eth and the interest after a week will be 12 eth.
But from a user's perspective, he actually gets 54 eth due to the protocol fee.
So the actual interest rate is (72-54)/54=33.33%. I believe this is not what a user and the protocol intended.
It is reasonable for the user to pay 54\*20% as an interest.

## Impact

The loan terms will be seen inconsistent for the borrowers and this will affect the protocol reputation because people will say the vault is charging additional interest for the protocol fee.

## Recommendation

Create a lien token after taking the protocol fee as below.

```solidity
function _requestLienAndIssuePayout(
  IAstariaRouter.LienDetails memory ld,
  IAstariaRouter.Commitment calldata c,
  address receiver
) internal returns (uint256) {
  //uint256 newLienId = IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).requestLienPosition(ld, c);

  uint256 payout = _handleProtocolFee(c.lienRequest.amount);
  ERC20(underlying()).safeTransfer(receiver, payout);

  c.lienRequest.amount -= payout; // @audit change here
  uint256 newLienId = IAstariaRouter(ROUTER()).requestLienPosition(ld, c);
  return newLienId;
}

```
