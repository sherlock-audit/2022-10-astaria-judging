# `AuctionHouse.cancelAuction()` doesn't refund the last bidder.

## Summary
`AuctionHouse.cancelAuction()` doesn't refund the last bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `AuctionHouse.createBid()`, bidders can place a bid with any price less than `reservePrice`.

And `AuctionHouse.cancelAuction()` cancels the auction if the current bid price is less than `reservePrice`.

```solidity
  function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
    external
    requiresAuth
  {
    require(
      auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
    );
    _handleIncomingPayment(
      auctionId,
      auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      canceledBy
    );
    _cancelAuction(auctionId);
  }
```

But it doesn't refund when there is a bidder with a bid price lower than `reservePrice`.

## Impact
The last bidder might lose his funds after the auction is canceled.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should add a refund logic in `AuctionHouse.cancelAuction()`.

```solidity
  function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
    external
    requiresAuth
  {
    require(
      auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
    );

    // refund logic +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    address lastBidder = auctions[auctionId].bidder;
    if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
        _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, auctions[auctionId].currentBid);
    }

    _handleIncomingPayment(
      auctionId,
      auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
      canceledBy
    );
    _cancelAuction(auctionId);
  }
```
