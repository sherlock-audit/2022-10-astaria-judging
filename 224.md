# Inconsistent usage of `firstBidTime` in `AuctionHouse.createAuction()` and `AuctionHouse.createBid()`

## Summary
Inconsistent usage of `firstBidTime` in `AuctionHouse.createAuction()` and `AuctionHouse.createBid()`

## Vulnerability Detail
We use `firstBidTime` to store the first bid time for the auction.

In the `AuctionHouse.createAuction()`, it sets to the current time.

```solidity
    newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
```

But in the `AuctionHouse.createBid()`, we think the `firstBidTime` of the new aunction is 0 and handle new bids.

```solidity
    uint64 firstBidTime = auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime;
    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration, //@audit 0?
      "Auction expired"
    );
    require(
      amount > currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );

    // If this is the first valid bid, we should set the starting time now.
    // If it's not, then we should refund the last bidder
    uint256 vaultPayment = (amount - currentBid);

    if (firstBidTime == 0) { //@audit 0?
      auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
    } else if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
      uint256 lastBidderRefund = amount - vaultPayment;
      _handleOutGoingPayment(lastBidder, lastBidderRefund);
    }
```

So `AuctionHouse.createBid()` wouldn't work as expected because `firstBidTime != 0` for the first auction.

## Impact
`AuctionHouse.createBid()` wouldn't work properly because of the inconsistent declaration of `firstBidTime`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think we should modify `newAuction.firstBidTime = 0` in `createAuction()`.
