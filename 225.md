# Bidders might create bids to a not created auction and lose their funds.

## Summary
Bidders might create bids to a not created auction and lose their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bidders can create bids to the auction using `createBid()`.

```solidity
  function createBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external override {
    address lastBidder = auctions[tokenId].bidder;
    uint256 currentBid = auctions[tokenId].currentBid;
    uint256 duration = auctions[tokenId].duration;
    uint64 firstBidTime = auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime;
    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
      "Auction expired"
    );
    require(
      amount > currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```

The above 2 `require()` will be passed if `firstBidTime == 0` and `amount > currentBid = 0`.

So it means a bidder can create a bid to a not created auction properly.

After that, the auction will be initiated again when the auction is created and the bidders will lose their funds permanently.

## Impact
If bidders create bids to a non-created auction, they will lose their funds forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should add a requirement to prevent bids to an inactive auction.

There is an `auctionExists()` already to check the same thing and we can use this function in `createBid()`.

```solidity
  function createBid(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external override {
    address lastBidder = auctions[tokenId].bidder;
    uint256 currentBid = auctions[tokenId].currentBid;
    uint256 duration = auctions[tokenId].duration;
    uint64 firstBidTime = auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime;

    require(auctionExists(tokenId), "Auction doesn't exist"); //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
      "Auction expired"
    );
    require(
      amount > currentBid + ((currentBid * minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
      "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
    );
```
