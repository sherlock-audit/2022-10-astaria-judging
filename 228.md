# Borrower might get loss while repaying.

## Summary

The protocol should take payments only as much as the debt during the repaying process.

## Vulnerability Detail

The borrower can repay using the external function `makePayment` at LienToken.sol#397.
This function calls an internal function `_payment` and if the payment amount is greater than the debt, it burns the LienToken.
After doing this, the protocol takes all the `paymentAmount` but this can be bigger than the actual debt.
So it is not reasonable to take the whole payment.

```solidity

function _payment(
  uint256 collateralId,
  uint8 position,
  uint256 paymentAmount,
  address payer
) internal returns (uint256) {

  ...
  // #645
  TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(WETH, payer, payee, paymentAmount); //@audit this should take only as much as the debt, not more

  emit Payment(lienId, paymentAmount);
  return paymentAmount;
}

```

## Impact

A borrower might get loss while repaying.

## Recommendation

Fix the `_payment` function as below.

```solidity
function _payment(
  uint256 collateralId,
  uint8 position,
  uint256 paymentAmount,
  address payer
) internal returns (uint256) {

  ...
  // #645
  paymentAmount = paymentAmount >= lien.amount ? lien.amount : paymentAmount;  //@audit take only as much as necessary
  TRANSFER_PROXY.tokenTransferFrom(WETH, payer, payee, paymentAmount);

  emit Payment(lienId, paymentAmount);
  return paymentAmount;
}

```
