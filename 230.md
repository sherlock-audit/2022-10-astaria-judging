# WithdrawProxy allows anyone to deposit/mint, resulting in malicious enlargement of shares.

## Summary
WithdrawProxy.sol is ERC4626Cloned , and #deposit() and #mint() is "public"  
when before call vault#transferWithdrawReserve()
a malicious user can use very small eth to get very large shares via WithdrawProxy#deposit() 

## Vulnerability Detail
Steps:
1. Normal user A executes vault#redeemFutureEpoch(100 eth) to get WithdrawProxy#shares == 100, (note :  at this time WithdrawProxy#assert == 0)

2. Malicious user B transfers 1 wei to WithdrawProxy via WETH#transfer(address(WithdrawProxy,1), then WithdrawProxy#assert will equal 1, and then Malicious user B  execute WithdrawProxy#deposit(1 wei)
This time user B will get 100 shares , because at this time convertToShares(1) == 100 shares

3. so with a very small 1 wei to get 100 shares , it will steal the share of user A


Other: execute step 2 before vault#processEpoch() is executed, it can even steal vault's percentage.
## Impact
Stealing ETH from users

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/ERC4626-Cloned.sol#L305

ERC4626-Cloned#deposit()
```solidity 
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver)
    public
    virtual
    override(IVault)
    returns (uint256 shares)
  {

   /*** public ****/

```

PublicVault#redeemFutureEpoch()
```solidity
  function redeemFutureEpoch(
    uint256 shares,
    address receiver,
    address owner,
    uint64 epoch
  ) public virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
...

    WithdrawProxy(withdrawProxies[epoch]).mint(receiver, shares); 
    /*** when mint share =100 ,but asset=0***/


```

same example code

```solidity
  function testWithdrawProxy() public {
...
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    PublicVault(publicVault).processEpoch();

+  vm.deal(address(1), 101);
+    vm.startPrank(address(1));
+    WETH9.deposit{value: 101}();    
+    WETH9.transfer(withdrawProxy,1);
+    WETH9.approve(withdrawProxy,100);
+    WithdrawProxy(withdrawProxy).deposit(100,address(1));
+    console.log("balance",IERC20(withdrawProxy).balanceOf(address(1)));
+    vm.stopPrank(); 


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
WithdrawProxy override #deposit()/#mint() to disable 
or remove  #deposit()/#mint() from ERC4626Cloned
