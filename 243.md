# Users will lose assets / shares if they withdraw funds from the WithdrawProxy before ending of the next epoch.

## Summary
Users will lose assets if they withdraw funds from the WithdrawProxy before ending of the next epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case a future epoch is scheduled for withdraw, WithdrawProxy is deployed, and withdraw share is minted to the user.

But transferWithdrawReserve is responsible for transferring underlying tokens to the WithdrawProxy. Assume withdrawReserve is not fully transferred to the WithdrawProxy (partially deposited / withdrawReserve > withdraw). So, there aren't enough assets in the WithdrawProxy.

Next, the user call withdraw in WithdrawProxy

It will calculate the share required to withdraw the assets

Since totalAssets() is less than it should be due to partial deposit, previewWithdraw returns more shares than it should.

After the user withdraws the fund, it will burn more shares than it should. Which is a fund loss since users receive fewer assets from withdrawing all shares.

A similar scenario applies to the redeem function.

## Impact
Users will lose assets if they withdraw funds from the WithdrawProxy before ending of the next epoch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in WithdrawProxy's withdraw and redeem functions to check whether that epoch has already ended and the fund actually transferred
