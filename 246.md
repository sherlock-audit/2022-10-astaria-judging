# ecrecover returns zero address for invalid signatures

## Summary
When ```ecrecover``` is fed with incorrect values of ```v, r, s```, it does not revert but returns an empty address 0x0.

## Vulnerability Detail
function ```_validateCommitment``` expects a valid signature from the strategist:
```solidity
    address recovered = ecrecover(
      ...
      params.lienRequest.v,
      params.lienRequest.r,
      params.lienRequest.s
    );
    require(
      recovered == params.lienRequest.strategy.strategist,
      "strategist must match signature"
    );
    require(
      recovered == owner() || recovered == delegate,
      "invalid strategist"
    );
```
The recovered address must either be an ```owner``` or a ```delegate```. It is totally possible that ```delegate``` is not set (an empty address) because the protocol does not enforce that.

## Impact
When the ```delegate``` address is not set, a signature check can be bypassed and malicious strategy data accepted as valid.

## Recommendation
require recovered is not address(0) or use OZ ECDSA library.
