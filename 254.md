# Admin privilleges

## Summary
Changes in settings do not have restrictions and immediately take effect.

## Vulnerability Detail
All the main contracts contain the function ```file``` that allows an admin to adjust the settings. While I want to believe the admin will behave like an honest human being, as an auditor based on previous experiences I have to flag this as a potential issue. These ```file``` functions provide an admin with great power and control over the protocol, and there are basically no validations against the new values.

## Impact
Users can be frontrunned with changes not in their favor and overall the admin has high influence over the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inform users, use timelock, and introduce reasonable lower/upper boundaries or slippage for critical parameters. In the future, admin privileges might be transferred to a DAO.
