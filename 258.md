# If an auction has no bidder, the NFT ownership should go back to the loan lenders

## Summary

The lenders in principal have the claim for the loan collateral, but current rule will let the liquidation caller get the collateral for free. Effectively take advantage from the vault LP, which is not fair.


## Vulnerability Detail

After the `endAuction()`, the collateral will be released to the initiator. Essentially, the initiator gets the NFT for free. But the lenders of the loan take the loss.

However, the lenders should have the claim to the collateral, since originally the funds are provided by the lenders. If the collateral at the end is owned by whoever calls the liquidation function, it is not fair for the lenders. And will discourage future users to use the protocol.


## Impact

- Lenders could suffer fund loss in some cases.
- The unfair mechanism will discourage future users.


## Code Snippet

If there is no bidder, the winner will be assigned to the auction initiator. And the debts will all be wrote off.

If there is no bidder for the auction, allow the NFT to get auctioned for another chance.
