# Liquidity providers can lose funds when a withdraw proxy is not set for an epoch

## Summary
Liquidity providers can lose funds when a withdraw proxy is not set for an epoch
## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferWithdrawReserve` function of `PublicVault` sends withdrawal reserves to a `WithdrawProxy` ([PublicVault.sol#L341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L341))
and subtracts transferred amount from the reserves. However, if a withdraw proxy is not set for an epoch, there's a false positive: `withdrawReserve` is updated but no funds are actually transferred:
```solidity
function transferWithdrawReserve() public {
  // check the available balance to be withdrawn
  uint256 withdraw = ERC20(underlying()).balanceOf(address(this));
  emit TransferWithdraw(withdraw, withdrawReserve);

  // prevent transfer of more assets then are available
  if (withdrawReserve <= withdraw) {
    withdraw = withdrawReserve;
    withdrawReserve = 0;
  } else {
    withdrawReserve -= withdraw;
  }
  emit TransferWithdraw(withdraw, withdrawReserve);

  address currentWithdrawProxy = withdrawProxies[currentEpoch - 1]; //
  // prevents transfer to a non-existent WithdrawProxy
  // withdrawProxies are indexed by the epoch where they're deployed
  if (currentWithdrawProxy != address(0)) { // @audit false positive: transferring is skipped silently
    ERC20(underlying()).safeTransfer(currentWithdrawProxy, withdraw);
    emit WithdrawReserveTransferred(withdraw);
  }
}
```
## Impact
Liquidity providers might not be able to withdraw liquidity they requested because it wasn't transferred to a WithdrawProxy due to a mistake, yet accounting was updated.

## Recommendation
Consider reverting in the case when no withdraw proxy is set for the current epoch.
