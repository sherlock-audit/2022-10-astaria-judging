# UniqueValidator.sol#L29-L30 : events - LogLeaf and LogDetails are not used anywhere

## Summary

UniqueValidator.sol#L29-L30 : events - LogLeaf and LogDetails are not used anywhere
LogLeaf  and LogDetails  events are added to fetch the information for front end use. I think they are not used anywhere in code.

I am adding it as medium issue, because the event are declared but not used.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/strategies/UniqueValidator.sol#L29-L30

Above code has the event declaration.

## Impact
Event information will be missed.
Following important use will be missed out.
Events notify the applications about the change made to the contracts and applications which can be used to execute the dependent logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use it in respective places in UniqueValidator.sol contract.

Similarly add event info in UNI_V3Validator.sol and CollectionValidator.sol if needed. This is a useful information.
