# commitToLiens via AstariaRouter will not work

## Summary

I assume that calling ```commitToLiens``` on ```AstariaRouter``` should revert. Please see the details.

## Vulnerability Detail

When committing to liens via a router, first it transfers the NFT from the user directly to the ```COLLATERAL_TOKEN```. This should trigger ```onERC721Received``` and mint the corresponding collateral token. The token is minted directly to the user, not the operator (router):
```solidity
      address depositFor = operator_;

      if (operator_ != from_) {
        depositFor = from_;
      }

      _mint(depositFor, collateralId);
```
However, it seems that the router fails to account for that and later tries to ```_returnCollateral``` to the user. This should revert the tx because the router does not own the collateral.
```solidity
    COLLATERAL_TOKEN.transferFrom(address(this), receiver, collateralId);
```

## Impact
This makes it impossible to commit via router and the user needs to explicitly execute several actions in a direct sequence.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You do not need to return the collateral if it already belongs to the user or the collateral token should be minted to the operator not the user depending on intentions.
