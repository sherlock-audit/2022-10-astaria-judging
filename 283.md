# Bidder lost asset If auction is cancelled

## Summary
Bidder lost asset If auction is cancelled

## Vulnerability Detail
In `cancelAuction()` there is no mechanism to return or refund bidder asset (WETH) if the Auction is being cancelled. 
There is only one condition to prevent cancelling an Auction, 
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
214:     require(
215:       auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
216:       "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
217:     );
```
So, if the `currentBid` is below the `reservePrice`, it can be cancelled.

When a user want to Bid an Auction, they can put any amount they want (for the first bidder, and next bidder need to increase with some percentage). If any first bidder (or next bidder) in which their bid amount is below `reservePrice` it can be accepted as a valid bid, unfortunately, if then the Auction is cancelled, their asset will be lost.

Initially this cancel function might be used to cancel an auction if there is no bidder, and need to change some properties. So if there is a bidder, this should not be allowed. If this function can be called on a running Auction which already have a bidder, that bidder will lost it spot and asset.

## Impact
Bidder will lost their asset and bid position if their bid amount below `reservePrice` and the Auction is cancelled.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
File: AuctionHouse.sol
210:   function cancelAuction(uint256 auctionId, address canceledBy)
211:     external
212:     requiresAuth
213:   {
214:     require(
215:       auctions[auctionId].currentBid < auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
216:       "cancelAuction: Auction is at or above reserve"
217:     );
218:     _handleIncomingPayment(
219:       auctionId,
220:       auctions[auctionId].reservePrice,
221:       canceledBy
222:     );
223:     _cancelAuction(auctionId);
224:   }
```
