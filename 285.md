# Auction still exists even paid off the loan

## Summary

The auction will not be cancelled even the loan is paid off. As a result, the collateral will still be liquidated. If the bid is very low, the lenders of other positions of the collateral could have fund loss.


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following case:
A collateral is taking 2 different loan, 1 for a private vault with duration of 15 days for $100, 1 for a public vault with duration of 30 days for $1,000. Say after 15 days, the loan is not paid back, it will be liquidated and put on auction.

Now, if the borrower pays back the first loan, but the auction won't be cancelled and still be alive. Then the collateral could be liquidated and the 2nd loan lender could suffer fund loss.


## Impact

Some lenders could loss fund they do not deserve.



## Code Snippet

The auction won't be changed even after paid off the 1st lien token loan.
