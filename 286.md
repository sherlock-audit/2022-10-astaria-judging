# LienToken.sol#L594 : _payment is taking all. It is not refunding the excess amount back to user.

## Summary

When making payment from a payer to a specific lien against a CollateralToken, all the payment amount is taken.

This is applicable even if `lien.amount < paymentAmount` - payment amount is more. User could loss his/her amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

If user pay more amount as payment, the current implementation does not return the excess amount back to user.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing logic to handle the excess payment and return the extra value back to the user.

This will maintain the healthy relationship between the end to user and to the protocol.
