# AuctionHouse.sol#L67 : createAuction misses the critical check to verify whether the auction already exists.

## Summary

AuctionHouse.sol#L67 : createAuction misses the critical check to verify whether the auction already exists.

createAuction is external function that mean it can be directly call with `requiresAuth`. there is no check whether the auction is already exists or not.

I understand the auction can be created from other place where it has this check. but this function is external, can be called directly. so added this as medium issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

Above lines of code tells about the auction creation. That does not have any check to verify whether the auction already there or not.

The existing auction will be overwritten.

## Impact

The existing auction data will be overwritten.
