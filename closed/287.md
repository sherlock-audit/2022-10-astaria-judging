# `AuctionHouse` - `createBid`: incorrect amount transferred

## Summary
In [`createBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L118), the incorrect amount is transferred from the bidder.

## Vulnerability Detail
At this line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L118

It should be `amount` instead of `vaultPayment`.

## Impact
Anyone can extract funds by creating 2 successive bids to get reimbursed a larger amount that what has been paid.
