# Function returns incorrect value

## Summary
Function `name()` on PublicVault.sol#61 does not return underlying asset's name but it's symbol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function is expected to return the underlying asset's name and instead returns its symbol. 

## Impact
Users are expecting to return the name for their underlying token, and they would not be able to get it through this function due to incorrect implementation.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function name() public view override returns (string memory) {
    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(underlying()).symbol()));
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Return the underlying asset's name:
```solidity
  function name() public view override returns (string memory) {
    return string(abi.encodePacked("AST-Vault-", ERC20(underlying()).name()));
  }
```
