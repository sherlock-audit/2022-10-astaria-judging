# Public vault owner can rug and steal all funds

## Summary

The owner of a Public Vault is able to sign any message to set the rates at which a user can borrow for a given NFT. This gives them the ability to offer all the vault's funds for a worthless NFT in order to rug and steal all the funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since strategists are able to arbitrarily set the parameters of the strategies they are willing to accept, this gives them the opportunity to sign off on strategies that allow them to steal all of the vault's funds.

For example, a strategist might do the following:
- Create a worthless NFT and deposit it as collateral
- Sign a strategy that they are willing to lend all of the vault's funds with this NFT as collateral
- Borrow all the funds in the vault, and disappear off into the horizon

## Impact

Users must trust their vault's owner not to rug, and cannot trust the system to limit the vault owner's power.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I don't think there's a way to solve this without rearchitecting the platform, but user's should be made aware that they are not just making a decision to trust a vault owner's current strategies, but also their future strategies and character. This may require additional information about public vault owners to be publicly available so users can make informed decisions.
