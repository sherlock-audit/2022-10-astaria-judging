# Unexpected spent high gas fee to deploy code

## Summary
Users may pay the higher gas fees they did not expect
found by [Tomosuke0930](https://github.com/Tomosuke0930)

## Vulnerability Detail
If there is no WithdrawProxy contract for the `currentEpoch`, users have to deploy the new contract with a high gas fee.

## Impact
High gas

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-10-astaria-UNCHAIN/blob/main/src/PublicVault.sol#L178-L212
```solidity
function redeemFutureEpoch(
    uint256 shares,
    address receiver,
    address owner,
    uint64 epoch
  ) public virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
   //@audit-issue it is high cost for user to deploy new contract
   // they can't expected
    _deployWithdrawProxyIfNotDeployed(epoch);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the contract doesn't exist, revert instead of deploying it. 
Or this should convey the front-end and the benefits of deploying should be presented to users. 
Deploying a new contract should be the user's choice since it's so expensive.
