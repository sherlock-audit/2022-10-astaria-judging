# createBid for nonexisting auction

## Summary
```createBid``` does not validate if an auction exists.

## Vulnerability Detail
Auctions are stored in a mapping:
```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => IAuctionHouse.Auction) auctions;
```
Meaning it is possible to retrieve every entry by an index. A not yet created entry will return default values (0s).

function ```createBid``` is a bit messed up, e.g. here it allows a ```firstBidTime``` of 0:
```solidity
    uint64 firstBidTime = auctions[tokenId].firstBidTime;
    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
      "Auction expired"
    );
```
however, it can never happen in practice because when ```firstBidTime``` is 0, this line will underflow later:
```solidity
    if (firstBidTime + duration - block.timestamp < timeBuffer) {
```
In practice, ```firstBidTime``` is never 0 because function ```createAuction``` sets it as if it is the first bid:
```solidity
    newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
```
So intentions are not entirely clear here but if any of these precautions were removed it would be possible to bid on a nonexisting auction.

## Impact
I've assigned this a Low severity because the function is messed up enough to make it impossible to exploit in practice. Still, this issue could become relevant if you decide to refactor it. And as far as I understand the potential exploiter would only lose funds because it is impossible to end such an auction.

```solidity
  require(auctionExists(tokenId), "Auction doesn't exist");
```
