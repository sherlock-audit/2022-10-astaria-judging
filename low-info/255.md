# Strategist fee is not used

## Summary
Variables for strategist fees are basically unused.

## Vulnerability Detail
```strategistFeeNumerator``` and ```strategistFeeDenominator``` are declared and initialized but never used meaningfully leaving questions about what were the intentions and why are they present in the codebase. Also function ```getStrategistFee``` becomes misleading then for an external reader.

## Impact
It is not entirely clear to me if these variables were left from the previous version of the codebase (refactoring) or if a strategist fee is not charged and it is a bug in the codebase. I've assigned a severity of low to let you know about this issue and make an appropriate decision.

## Recommendation
Depending on intentions, charge the strategist fees or remove them from the codebase.
