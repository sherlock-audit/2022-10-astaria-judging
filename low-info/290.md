# Astaria protocol will miss the ERC1155 based NFT tokens

## Summary

This can be consider either medium or QA. But I want to notify that the current implementation does not consider the ERC1155 based NFT tokens for NFT based lending.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the NFT token is ERC1155 based, Astaira will not provide the NFT based lending.

## Impact

Astaira will miss out the ERC1155 based NFT tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement to support ERC1155 based NFT as well.
