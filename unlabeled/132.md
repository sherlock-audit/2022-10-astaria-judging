# Released collateral ERC721 might be locked forever

## Summary
If a smart contract that can't handle ERC721 tokens is the recipient of a collateral release, then the token will be stuck there forever

## Vulnerability Detail
In `CollateralToken.sol` we have two functionalities, `releaseToAddress()` and `endAuction()` that transfer an ERC721 token to a recipient with the following code `IERC721(underlyingAsset).transferFrom(address(this), releaseTo, assetId);` but the transferFrom() method from the ERC721 standard does not check if the _to argument is a smart contract that can handle ERC721 tokens. 
Since it is possible that any address is the final recipient of the token, it is possible that the it is a smart contract wallet or just a smart contract instead of an EOA. If this smart contract canâ€™t handle ERC721 tokens then they will be stuck in it forever. To be safe from this scenario, the ERC721 standard defined the safeTransferFrom function that has the following comment in its NatSpec:
`
When transfer is complete, this function checks if _to is a smart contract (code size > 0). If so, it calls onERC721Received on _to and throws if the return value is not bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`

## Impact
Using ERC721::transferFrom instead of ERC721::safeTransferFrom can result in a stuck NFT or NFTs for a user, which can be worth a substantial amount, for example if the NFT is a Bored Ape the user will lose an NFT that has a six figure dollar value amount.

## Recommendation
Use ERC721's `safeTransferFrom` method instead of `transferFrom`
