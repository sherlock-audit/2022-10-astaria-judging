# initiatorFee in createAuction() has no upperbound and can be set at a percentage above 100%

## Summary

Every bid is required to pay the initiator a certain amount of fee. However, the upper limit is not set so the creator of the Auction can accidentally or maliciously set a high fee so each bid that goes through pays the initiator instead of paying the loan

## Vulnerability Detail

In createAuction(), a user that is authorized can set the parameters for initiatorFee. However, there is no upper bound / fixed fee so the creator can set any amount that he wants.

This initiatorFee is used in _handleIncomingPayments() and is used to pay the initiator.

    uint256 initiatorPayment = transferAmount.mulDivDown(
      auction.initiatorFee,
      100
    ); //maybe consider making protocl computed like other fees

## Impact

Lien loans will not be paid and creator can take all the fees.
