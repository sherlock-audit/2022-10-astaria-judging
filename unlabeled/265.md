# initiator in createAuction can be set to address(0)

## Summary

Address(0) is not checked for the initiator parameter in createAuction, which means that people can bid in an auction that is governed by address(0) or an address(0) can win the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since createAuction() has an external visibility modifier and not internal, it does not check whether the Auction exist, unlike [auctionVault() in CollateralToken.sol which calls createAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/CollateralToken.sol#L310-L325). An authorized user can createAuction by directly calling createAuction() and continue the bidding process without knowing that address(0) is set.

## Impact

Bidders might lose their bid because Auction doesn't exist or NFT can be won by address(0) if there is no bidding.

## Recommendation

Set createAuction() to be internal or add 

    require(
      !AUCTION_HOUSE.auctionExists(collateralId),
      "auctionVault: auction already exists"
    );

in the createAuction() function.

Also add in AuctionExist check in createBid() to make sure that the Auction exists by changing

    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration,
      "Auction expired"
    );

to 

    require(
      firstBidTime == 0 || block.timestamp < firstBidTime + duration || auctions[tokenId].initiator != address(0),
      "Auction expired"
    );
