# `Auction House` - Auction creator does not pay the `reservePrice`

## Summary
In `createAuction` which is called when `liquidate` in `AstariaRouter` is called, `msg.sender` pays nothing although he will be the initiator of the auction and the recipient of the auction fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no access control so anyone can call `liquidate`. But when a successful call to liquidate occurs, `msg.sender` is saved as being the initiator and the recipient of the auction fees [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/lib/astaria-gpl/src/AuctionHouse.sol#L78).

 - this person will win the auction if there is no other bids.
 - this person can get reimbursed the reserve price if he makes bids

## Impact
Liquidators steal funds from the protocol as they are not paying the reservePrice anywhere.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function createAuction(
  uint256 tokenId,
  uint256 duration,
  address initiator,
  uint256 initiatorFee
) external requiresAuth returns (uint256 reserve) {
  (reserve, ) = LIEN_TOKEN.stopLiens(tokenId);

  Auction storage newAuction = auctions[tokenId];
  newAuction.duration = duration.safeCastTo64();
  newAuction.reservePrice = reserve;
  newAuction.initiator = initiator;
  newAuction.initiatorFee = initiatorFee;
  newAuction.firstBidTime = block.timestamp.safeCastTo64();
  newAuction.maxDuration = (duration + 1 days).safeCastTo64();
  newAuction.currentBid = 0;

  emit AuctionCreated(tokenId, duration, reserve);
}
```

## Recommendation
Make sure the user calling `liquidate` pays the reserve price.
